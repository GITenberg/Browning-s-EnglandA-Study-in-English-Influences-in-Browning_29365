<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="subtitle">ENGLISH POETS, FRIENDS AND ENTHUSIASMS</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">To</span> any one casually trying to recall what
England has given Robert Browning
by way of direct poetical inspiration, it is
more than likely that the little poem about
Shelley, "Memorabilia" would at once occur:</p>

<h4 class="sidenote">I</h4>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ah, did you once see Shelley plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And did he stop and speak to you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And did you speak to him again?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How strange it seems and new!<br /></span>
</div></div>
<h4 class="sidenote">II</h4>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But you were living before that,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And also you are living after;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the memory I started at&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My starting moves your laughter!<br /></span>
</div></div>
<h4 class="sidenote">III</h4>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I crossed a moor, with a name of its own<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And a certain use in the world, no doubt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet a hand's-breadth of it shines alone<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Mid the blank miles round about:<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>
<h4 class="sidenote">IV</h4>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For there I picked up on the heather<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And there I put inside my breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moulted feather, an eagle-feather!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Well, I forget the rest."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It puts into a mood and a symbol the almost
worshipful admiration felt by Browning for
the poet in his youth, which he had, many
years before this little lyric was written, recorded
in a finely appreciative passage in
"Pauline."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sun-treader, life and light be thine forever!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou are gone from us; years go by and spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gladdens and the young earth is beautiful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet thy songs come not, other bards arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But none like thee: they stand, thy majesties,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like mighty works which tell some spirit there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath sat regardless of neglect and scorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, its long task completed, it hath risen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left us, never to return, and all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rush in to peer and praise when all in vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The air seems bright with thy past presence yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou art still for me as thou hast been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I have stood with thee as on a throne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all thy dim creations gathered round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like mountains, and I felt of mould like them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with them creatures of my own were mixed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like things, half-lived, catching and giving life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou art still for me who have adored<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' single, panting but to hear thy name<br /></span><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
<span class="i0">Which I believed a spell to me alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce deeming thou wast as a star to men!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one should worship long a sacred spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce worth a moth's flitting, which long grasses cross,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one small tree embowers droopingly&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joying to see some wandering insect won<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To live in its few rushes, or some locust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pasture on its boughs, or some wild bird<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stoop for its freshness from the trackless air:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then should find it but the fountain-head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long lost, of some great river washing towns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And towers, and seeing old woods which will live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But by its banks untrod of human foot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, when the great sun sinks, lie quivering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In light as some thing lieth half of life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before God's foot, waiting a wondrous change;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then girt with rocks which seek to turn or stay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its course in vain, for it does ever spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a sea's arm as it goes rolling on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being the pulse of some great country&mdash;so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wast thou to me, and art thou to the world!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, perchance, half feel a strange regret<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I am not what I have been to thee:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a girl one has silently loved long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her first loneliness in some retreat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, late emerged, all gaze and glow to view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her fresh eyes and soft hair and lips which bloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a mountain berry: doubtless it is sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see her thus adored, but there have been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moments when all the world was in our praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweeter than any pride of after hours.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, sun-treader, all hail! From my heart's heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bid thee hail! E'en in my wildest dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I proudly feel I would have thrown to dust<br /></span><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
<span class="i0">The wreaths of fame which seemed o'erhanging me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see thee for a moment as thou art."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Browning was only fourteen when Shelley
first came into his literary life. The story has
often been told of how the young Robert,
passing a bookstall one day spied in a box of
second-hand volumes, a shabby little edition
of Shelley advertised "Mr. Shelley's Atheistical
Poems: very scarce." It seems almost
incredible to us now that the name was an absolutely
new one to him, and that only by
questioning the bookseller did he learn that
Shelley had written a number of volumes of
poetry and that he was now dead. This accident
was sufficient to inspire the incipient poet's
curiosity, and he never rested until he was the
owner of Shelley's works. They were hard
to get hold of in those early days but the persistent
searching of his mother finally unearthed
them at Olliers' in Vere Street, London.
She brought him also three volumes of Keats,
who became a treasure second only to Shelley.</p>

</div>

<p>The question of Shelley's influence on
Browning's art has been one often discussed.
There are many traces of Shelleyan music
and idea in his early poems "Pauline," "Paracelsus,"
and "Sordello," but no marked nor
lasting impression was made upon Browning's
development as a poet by Shelley. Upon<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
Browning's personal development Shelley exerted
a short-lived though somewhat intense
influence. We see the young enthusiast professing
the atheism of his idol as the liberal
views of Shelley were then interpreted, and
even becoming a vegetarian. As time went
on the discipleship vanished, and in its place
came the recognition on Browning's part of a
poetic spirit akin yet different from his own.
The last trace of the disciple appears in
"Sordello" when the poet addresses Shelley
among the audience of dead great ones he has
mustered to listen to the story of Sordello:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;"Stay&mdash;thou, spirit, come not near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now&mdash;not this time desert thy cloudy place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To scare me, thus employed, with that pure face!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I need not fear this audience, I make free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With them, but then this is no place for thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thunder-phrase of the Athenian, grown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up out of memories of Marathon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would echo like his own sword's grinding screech<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Braying a Persian shield,&mdash;the silver speech<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Sidney's self, the starry paladin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn intense as a trumpet sounding in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Knights to tilt,&mdash;wert thou to hear!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Shelley appears in the work of Browning
once more in the prose essay on Shelley
which was written to a volume of spurious
letters of that poet published in 1851. In
this is summed up in a masterful paragraph<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
reflecting Browning's unusual penetration into
the secret paths of the poetic mind, the characteristics
of a poet of Shelley's order. The
paragraph is as follows:</p>

<p>"We turn with stronger needs to the genius
of an opposite tendency&mdash;the subjective poet
of modern classification. He, gifted like the
objective poet, with the fuller perception of
nature and man, is impelled to embody the
thing he perceives, not so much with reference
to the many below as to the One above him,
the supreme Intelligence which apprehends
all things in their absolute truth,&mdash;an ultimate
view ever aspired to, if but partially
attained, by the poet's own soul. Not what
man sees, but what God sees,&mdash;the <i>Ideas</i> of
Plato, seeds of creation lying burningly on
the Divine Hand,&mdash;it is toward these that
he struggles. Not with the combination
of humanity in action, but with the primal
elements of humanity, he has to do; and
he digs where he stands,&mdash;preferring to seek
them in his own soul as the nearest reflex of
that absolute Mind, according to the intuitions
of which he desires to perceive and speak.
Such a poet does not deal habitually with the
picturesque groupings and tempestuous tossings
of the forest-trees, but with their roots
and fibers naked to the chalk and stone. He<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
does not paint pictures and hang them on the
walls, but rather carries them on the retina of
his own eyes: we must look deep into his
human eyes, to see those pictures on them. He
is rather a seer, accordingly, than a fashioner,
and what he produces will be less a work than
an effluence. That effluence cannot be easily
considered in abstraction from his personality,&mdash;being
indeed the very radiance and aroma
of his personality, projected from it but not
separated. Therefore, in our approach to
the poetry, we necessarily approach the personality
of the poet; in apprehending it, we
apprehend him, and certainly we cannot love
it without loving him. Both for love's and for
understanding's sake we desire to know him,
and, as readers of his poetry, must be readers
of his biography too."</p>

<p>Finally, the little "Memorabilia" lyric gives
a mood of cherished memory of the Sun-Treader,
who beaconed him upon the heights
in his youth, and has now become a molted
eagle-feather held close to his heart.</p>

<p>Keats' lesser but assured place in the poet's
affections comes out in the pugnacious lyric,
"Popularity," one of the old-time bits of
ammunition shot from the guns of those who
found Browning "obscure." The poem is an
"apology" for any unappreciated poet with<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
the true stuff in him, but the allusion to Keats
shows him to have been the fuse that fired this
mild explosion against the dullards who pass
by unknowing and uncaring of a genius,
though he pluck with one hand thoughts
from the stars, and with the other fight off
want.</p>

Wordsworth, it appears, was, so to speak,
the inverse inspiration of the stirring lines
"The Lost Leader." Browning's strong sympathies
with the Liberal cause are here portrayed
with an ardor which is fairly intoxicating
poetically, but one feels it is scarcely just
to the mild-eyed, exemplary Wordsworth, and
perhaps exaggeratedly sure of Shakespeare's
attitude on this point. It is only fair to Browning,
to point out how he himself felt later that
his artistic mood had here run away with
him, whereupon he made amends honorable in
a letter in reply to the question whether he had
Wordsworth in mind: "I can only answer,
with something of shame and contrition, that
I undoubtedly had Wordsworth in my mind&mdash;but
simply as a model; you know an artist
takes one or two striking traits in the features
of his 'model,' and uses them to start his fancy
on a flight which may end far enough from the
good man or woman who happens to be sitting
for nose and eye. I thought of the great Poet's
abandonment of liberalism at an unlucky juncture,
and no repaying consequence that I
could ever see. But, once call my fancy-portrait
<i>Wordsworth</i>&mdash;and how much more
ought one to say!"</p>

<p>The defection of Wordsworth from liberal
sympathies is one of the commonplaces of<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
literary history. There was a time when he
figured in his poetry as a patriotic leader of
the people, when in clarion tones he exhorted
his countrymen to "arm and combine in defense
of their common birthright." But this
was in the enthusiasm of his youth when he
and Southey and Coleridge were metaphorically
waving their red caps for the principles of
the French Revolution. The unbridled actions
of the French Revolutionists, quickly
cooled off their ardor, and as Taine cleverly
puts it, "at the end of a few years, the three,
brought back into the pale of State and Church,
were, Coleridge, a Pittite journalist, Wordsworth,
a distributor of stamps, and Southey,
poet-laureate; all converted zealots, decided
Anglicans, and intolerant conservatives."
The "handful of silver" for which the patriot
in the poem is supposed to have left the cause
included besides the post of "distributor of
stamps," given to him by Lord Lonsdale in
1813, a pension of three hundred pounds a
year in 1842, and the poet-laureateship in
1843.</p>

<p>The first of these offices was received so long
after the cooling of Wordsworth's "Revolution"
ardors which the events of 1793 had
brought about that it can scarcely be said to
have influenced his change of mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>It was during Wordsworth's residence in
France, from November 1791 to December
1792, that his enthusiasm for the French
Revolution reached white heat. How the
change was wrought in his feelings is shown
with much penetration and sympathy by
Edward Dowden in his "French Revolution
and English Literature." "When war between
France and England was declared
Wordsworth's nature underwent the most
violent strain it had ever experienced. He
loved his native land yet he could wish for
nothing but disaster to her arms. As the
days passed he found it more and more difficult
to sustain his faith in the Revolution.
First, he abandoned belief in the leaders but
he still trusted to the people, then the people
seemed to have grown insane with the intoxication
of blood. He was driven back from
his defense of the Revolution, in its historical
development, to a bare faith in the abstract
idea. He clung to theories, the free and joyous
movement of his sympathies ceased;
opinions stifled the spontaneous life of the
spirit, these opinions were tested and retested
by the intellect, till, in the end, exhausted by
inward debate, he yielded up moral questions
in despair ... by process of the understanding
alone Wordsworth could attain no<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
vital body of truth. Rather he felt that
things of far more worth than political opinions&mdash;natural
instincts, sympathies, passions, intuitions&mdash;were
being disintegrated or denaturalized.
Wordsworth began to suspect
the analytic intellect as a source of moral
wisdom. In place of humanitarian dreams
came a deep interest in the joys and sorrows
of individual men and women; through his
interest in this he was led back to a study of
the mind of man and those laws which connect
the work of the creative imagination
with the play of the passions. He had begun
again to think nobly of the world and human
life." He was, in fact, a more thorough
Democrat socially than any but Burns of
the band of poets mentioned in Browning's
gallant company, not even excepting Browning
himself.</p>

<p>Whether an artist is justified in taking the
most doubtful feature of his model's physiognomy
and building up from it a repellent
portrait is question for debate, especially
when he admits its incompleteness. But we<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
may balance against this incompleteness, the
fine fire of enthusiasm for the "cause" in the
poem, and the fact that Wordsworth has
not been at all harmed by it. The worst
that has happened is the raising in our
minds of a question touching Browning's
good taste.</p>

<p>Just here it will be interesting to speak of a
bit of purely personal expression on the subject
of Browning's known liberal standpoint,
written by him in answer to the question propounded
to a number of English men of letters
and printed together with other replies in a
volume edited by Andrew Reid in 1885.</p>

Enthusiasm for liberal views comes out
again and again in the poetry of Browning.</p>

<p>His fullest treatment of the cause of political
liberty is in "Strafford," to be considered
in the third chapter, but many are
the hints strewn about his verse that bring
home with no uncertain touch the fact that
Browning lived man's "lover" and never
man's "hater." Take as an example "The
Englishman in Italy," where the sarcastic
turn he gives to the last stanza shows clearly
where his sympathies lie:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;"Such trifles!" you say?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fort&ugrave;, in my England at home,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">&mdash;If 't were proper, Scirocco should vanish<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In black from the skies!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>More the ordinary note of patriotism is
struck in "Home-thoughts, from the Sea,"
wherein the scenes of England's victories as
they come before the poet arouse pride in her
military achievements.</p>

<p>In two instances Browning celebrates English
friends in his poetry. The poems are
"Waring" and "May and Death."</p>

<p>Waring, who stands for Alfred Domett, is
an interesting figure in Colonial history as
well as a minor light among poets. But it is
highly probable that he would not have been
put into verse by Browning any more than
many other of the poet's warm friends if it
had not been for the incident described in
the poem which actually took place, and
made a strong enough impression to inspire a
creative if not exactly an exalted mood on
Browning's part. The incident is recorded in
Thomas Powell's "Living Authors of England,"
who writes of Domett, "We have a
vivid recollection of the last time we saw him.
It was at an evening party a few days before
he sailed from England; his intimate friend,
Mr. Browning, was also present. It happened
that the latter was introduced that
evening for the first time to a young author<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
who had just then appeared in the literary
world [Powell, himself]. This, consequently,
prevented the two friends from conversation,
and they parted from each other without
the slightest idea on Mr. Browning's part that
he was seeing his old friend Domett for the
last time. Some days after when he found
that Domett had sailed, he expressed in
strong terms to the writer of this sketch the
self-reproach he felt at having preferred the
conversation of a stranger to that of his old
associate."</p>

<p>This happened in 1842, when with no good-bys,
Domett sailed for New Zealand where
he lived for thirty years, and held during that
time many important official posts. Upon his
return to England, Browning and he met again,
and in his poem "Ranolf and Amohia," published
the year after, he wrote the often quoted
line so aptly appreciative of Browning's
genius,&mdash;"Subtlest assertor of the soul in
song."</p>

<p>The poem belongs to the <i>vers de soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i>
order, albeit the lightness is of a somewhat
ponderous variety. It, however, has
much interest as a character sketch from
the life, and is said by those who had the
opportunity of knowing to be a capital portrait.</p>

<p>The poet's one truly enthusiastic outburst
in connection with English Nature he sings
out in his longing for an English spring in
the incomparable little lyric "Home-thoughts,
from Abroad."</p>

<h3>HOME-THOUGHTS, FROM ABROAD</h3>

<span class="i0">That the lowest boughs and the brushwood sheaf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round the elm-tree bole are in tiny leaf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the chaffinch sings on the orchard bough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In England&mdash;now!<br /></span>
</div></div>
<h4 class="sidenote">II</h4>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And after April, when May follows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the whitethroat builds, and all the swallows!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hark, where my blossomed pear-tree in the hedge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leans to the field and scatters on the clover<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blossoms and dewdrops&mdash;at the bent spray's edge&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That's the wise thrush; he sings each song twice over<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest you should think he never could recapture<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first fine careless rapture!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, though the fields look rough with hoary dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All will be gay when noontide wakes anew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The buttercups, the little children's dower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Far brighter than this gaudy melon-flower!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After this it seems hardly possible that
Browning, himself speaks in "De Gustibus,"
yet long and happy living away from England
doubtless dimmed his sense of the beauty of
English landscape. "De Gustibus" was published
ten years later than "Home-Thoughts
from Abroad," when Italy and he had indeed
become "lovers old." A deeper reason than
mere delight in its scenery is also reflected
in the poem; the sympathy shared with Mrs.
Browning, for the cause of Italian independence.</p>

<p>Two or three English artists called forth
appreciation in verse from Browning. There
is the exquisite bit called "Deaf and Dumb,"
after a group of statuary by Woolner, of Constance
and Arthur&mdash;the deaf and dumb
children of Sir Thomas Fairbairn.</p>

<p>There is also the beautiful description in
"Balaustion's Adventure" of the Alkestis by
Sir Frederick Leighton.</p>

<p>The flagrant anachronism of making a
Greek girl at the time of the Fall of Athens
describe an English picture cannot but be
forgiven, since the artistic effect gained is so
fine. The poet quite convinces the reader
that Sir Frederick Leighton ought to have
been a Kaunian painter, if he was not, and
that Balaustion or no one was qualified to
appreciate his picture at its full worth.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I know, too, a great Kaunian painter, strong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Herakles, though rosy with a robe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of grace that softens down the sinewy strength:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he has made a picture of it all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There lies Alkestis dead, beneath the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She longed to look her last upon, beside<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Behind the body, I suppose there bends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Pheres in his hoary impotence;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And women-wailers, in a corner crouch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Four, beautiful as you four&mdash;yes, indeed!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close, each to other, agonizing all,<br /></span><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>

<span class="i0">Whereby the merely honest flesh and blood<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ere they can close with, clasp and overcome<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poisonous impalpability<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That simulates a form beneath the flow<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Why crown whom Zeus has crowned in soul before?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Once before had Sir Frederick Leighton
inspired the poet in the exquisite lines on
Eurydice.</p>

<h3>EURYDICE TO ORPHEUS</h3>

<p class="poemctr">A PICTURE BY LEIGHTON</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But give them me, the mouth, the eyes, the brow!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let them once more absorb me! One look now<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Will lap me round for ever, not to pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of its light, though darkness lie beyond:<br /></span><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
<span class="i0">Hold me but safe again within the bond<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of one immortal look! All woe that was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgotten, and all terror that may be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Defied,&mdash;no past is mine, no future: look at me!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Beautiful as these lines are, they do not
impress me as fully interpreting Leighton's
picture. The expression of Eurydice is
rather one of unthinking confiding affection&mdash;as
if she were really unconscious or
ignorant of the danger; while that of Orpheus
is one of passionate agony as he tries
to hold her off.</p>

<p>Though English art could not fascinate the
poet as Italian art did, for the fully sufficient
reason that it does not stand for a great epoch
of intellectual awakening, yet with what fair
alchemy he has touched those few artists he
has chosen to honor. Notwithstanding his
avowed devotion to Italy, expressed in "De
Gustibus," one cannot help feeling that in
the poems mentioned in this chapter, there is
that ecstasy of sympathy which goes only to
the most potent influences in the formation
of character. Something of what I mean is
expressed in one of his latest poems, "Development."
In this we certainly get a real
peep at young Robert Browning, led by his
wise father into the delights of Homer, by
slow degrees, where all is truth at first, to<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
end up with the devastating criticism of Wolf.
In spite of it all the dream stays and is the
reality. Nothing can obliterate the magic of
a strong early enthusiasm, as "fact still held"
"Spite of new Knowledge," in his "heart of
hearts."</p>

<span class="i0">This taught me who was who and what was what:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And still proves&mdash;thanks to that instructor sage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Father, who knew better than turn straight<br /></span>

<span class="i0">It happened, two or three years afterward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That&mdash;I and playmates playing at Troy's Siege&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"How would you like to read yourself the tale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Properly told, of which I gave you first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Merely such notion as a boy could bear?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The all-accomplished scholar, twelve years old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Who was it wrote the Iliad?"&mdash;what a laugh!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Get truth and falsehood known and named as such.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why did he ever let me dream at all,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Could not I have excogitated this<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now, growing double o'er the Stagirite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At least I soil no page with bread and milk,<br /></span>

<p>This chapter would not be complete without
Browning's tribute to dog Tray, whose
traits may not be peculiar to English dogs<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
but whose name is proverbially English. Besides
it touches a subject upon which the poet
had strong feelings. Vivisection he abhorred,
and in the controversies which were tearing
the scientific and philanthropic world asunder
in the last years of his life, no one was a more
determined opponent of vivisection than he.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="subtitle">SHAKESPEARE'S PORTRAIT</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">Once</span> and once only did Browning depart
from his custom of choosing people of
minor note to figure in his dramatic monologues.
In "At the 'Mermaid'" he ventures
upon the consecrated ground of a heart-to-heart
talk between Shakespeare, Ben Jonson,
and the wits who gathered at the classic
"Mermaid" Tavern in Cheapside, following
this up with further glimpses into the inner
recesses of Shakespeare's mind in the monologues
"House" and "Shop." It is a particularly
daring feat in the case of Shakespeare,
for as all the world knows any attempt at
getting in touch with the real man, Shakespeare,
must, per force, be woven out of such
"stuff as dreams are made on."</p>

<p>In interpreting this portraiture of one great
poet by another it will be of interest to
glance at the actual facts as far as they are
known in regard to the relations which
existed between Shakespeare and Jonson.
Praise and blame both are recorded on Jon<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>son's
part when writing of Shakespeare, yet
the praise shows such undisguised admiration
that the blame sinks into insignificance. Jonson's
"learned socks" to which Milton refers
probably tripped the critic up occasionally by
reason of their weight.</p>

<p>There is a charming story told of the
friendship between the two men recorded by
Sir Nicholas L'Estrange, within a very few
years of Shakespeare's death, who attributed
it to Dr. Donne. The story goes that
"Shakespeare was godfather to one of Ben
Jonson's children, and after the christening,
being in a deep study, Jonson came
to cheer him up and asked him why he was
so melancholy. 'No, faith, Ben,' says he,
'not I, but I have been considering a great
while what should be the fittest gift for me
to bestow upon my godchild, and I have resolved
at last.' 'I prythee what?' says he.
'I'faith, Ben, I'll e'en give him a dozen good
Lattin spoons, and thou shalt translate them.'"
If this must be taken with a grain of salt,
there is another even more to the honor of
Shakespeare reported by Rowe and considered
credible by such Shakespearian scholars as
Halliwell Phillipps and Sidney Lee. "His
acquaintance with Ben Jonson" writes Rowe,
"began with a remarkable piece of humanity<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
and good nature; Mr. Jonson, who was at
that time altogether unknown to the world,
had offered one of his plays to the players in
order to have it acted, and the persons into
whose hands it was put, after having turned
it carelessly and superciliously over, were
just upon returning it to him with an ill-natured
answer that it would be of no service
to their company, when Shakespeare
luckily cast his eye upon it, and found something
so well in it as to engage him first to
read it through, and afterwards to recommend
Mr. Jonson and his writings to the
public." The play in question was the famous
comedy of "Every Man in His Humour,"
which was brought out in September, 1598,
by the Lord Chamberlain's company, Shakespeare
himself being one of the leading actors
upon the occasion.</p>

<p>Authentic history records a theater war in
which Jonson and Shakespeare figured, on
opposite sides, but if allusions in Jonson's
play the "Poetaster" have been properly
interpreted, their friendly relations were not
deeply disturbed. The trouble began in the
first place by the London of 1600 suddenly
rushing into a fad for the company of boy
players, recruited chiefly from the choristers
of the Chapel Royal, and known as the "Chil<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>dren
of the Chapel." They had been acting
at the new theater in Blackfriars since 1597,
and their vogue became so great as actually
to threaten Shakespeare's company and other
companies of adult actors. Just at this time
Ben Jonson was having a personal quarrel
with his fellow dramatists, Marston and
Dekker, and as he received little sympathy
from the actors, he took his revenge by joining
his forces with those of the Children of
the Chapel. They brought out for him in
1600 his satire of "Cynthia's Revels," in
which he held up to ridicule Marston, Dekker
and their friends the actors. Marston and
Dekker, with the actors of Shakespeare's
company, prepared to retaliate, but Jonson
hearing of it forestalled them with his play
the "Poetaster" in which he spared neither
dramatists nor actors. Shakespeare's company
continued the fray by bringing out at
the Globe Theatre, in the following year,
Dekker and Marston's "Satiro-Mastix, or
The Untrussing of the Humorous Poet," and
as Ward remarks, "the quarrel had now become
too hot to last." The excitement,
however, continued for sometime, theater-goers
took sides and watched with interest
"the actors and dramatists' boisterous war
of personalities," to quote Mr. Lee, who<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
goes on to point out that on May 10, 1601,
the Privy Council called the attention of the
Middlesex magistrates to the abuse covertly
leveled by the actors of the "Curtain" at
gentlemen "of good desert and quality," and
directed the magistrates to examine all plays
before they were produced.</p>

<p>Jonson, himself, finally made apologies in
verses appended to printed copies of the "Poetaster."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now for the players 'tis true I tax'd them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet but some, and those so sparingly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As all the rest might have sat still unquestioned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had they but had the wit or conscience<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think well of themselves. But impotent they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thought each man's vice belonged to their whole tribe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And much good do it them. What they have done against me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am not moved with, if it gave them meat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or got them clothes, 'tis well: that was their end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only amongst them I was sorry for<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some better natures by the rest so drawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To run in that vile line."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sidney Lee cleverly deduces Shakespeare's
attitude in the quarrel in allusions to it in
"Hamlet," wherein he "protested against the
abusive comments on the men-actors of 'the
common' stages or public theaters which
were put into the children's mouths. Rosencrantz
declared that the children 'so berattle<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
[<i>i.e.</i> assail] the common stages&mdash;so they call
them&mdash;that many wearing rapiers are afraid
of goose-quills, and dare scarce come thither
[<i>i.e.</i> to the public theaters].' Hamlet in pursuit
of the theme pointed out that the writers
who encouraged the vogue of the 'child actors'
did them a poor service, because when
the boys should reach men's estate they would
run the risk, if they continued on the stage,
of the same insults and neglect which now
threatened their seniors.</p>

<p>"'<i>Hamlet.</i> What are they children? Who
maintains 'em? How are they escorted [<i>i.e.</i>
paid]? Will they pursue the quality [<i>i.e.</i> the
actor's profession] no longer than they can sing?
Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
themselves to common players&mdash;as it is most
like, if their means are no better&mdash;their writers
do them wrong to make them exclaim against
their own succession?</p>

<p>"'<i>Rosencrantz.</i> Faith, there has been much
to do on both sides, and the nation holds it
no sin to tarre [<i>i.e.</i> incite] them to controversy;
there was for a while no money bid
for argument, unless the poet and the player
went to cuffs in the question.'"</p>

<p>This certainly does not reflect a very belligerent
attitude since it merely puts in a
word for the grown-up actors rather than<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
casting any slurs upon the children. Further
indications of Shakespeare's mildness in regard
to the whole matter are given in the
Prologue to "Troylus and Cressida," where,
as Mr. Lee says, he made specific reference
to the strife between Ben Jonson and the
players in the lines</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"And hither am I come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Prologue arm'd, but not in confidence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Authors' pen, or Actors' voyce."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The most interesting bit of evidence to show
that Shakespeare and Jonson remained friends,
even in the heat of the conflict, may be gained
from the "Poetaster" itself if we admit that
the Virgil of the play, who is chosen peacemaker
stands for Shakespeare; and who so fit to be
peacemaker as Shakespeare for his amiable
qualities seem to have impressed themselves
upon all who knew him.</p>

<p>Following Mr. Lee's lead, "Jonson figures
personally in the 'Poetaster' under the name
of Horace. Episodically Horace and his
friends, Tibullus and Gallus, eulogize the
work and genius of another character, Virgil,
in terms so closely resembling those which
Jonson is known to have applied to Shakespeare
that they may be regarded as intended
to apply to him (Act V, Scene I). Jonson points<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
out that Virgil, by his penetrating intuition,
achieved the great effects which others laboriously
sought to reach through rules of art.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'His learning labors not the school-like gloss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That most consists of echoing words and terms ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor any long or far-fetched circumstance&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrapt in the curious generalities of arts&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a direct and analytic sum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the worth and first effects of art.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for his poesy, 'tis so rammed with life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That it shall gather strength of life with being,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And live hereafter, more admired than now.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><a name='TC_3'></a><ins title="Paragraph continued, no quote needed">Tibullus</ins> gives Virgil equal credit for having
in his writings touched with telling truth
upon every vicissitude of human existence:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'That which he hath writ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is with such judgment labored and distilled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all the needful uses of our lives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, could a man remember but his lines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He should not touch at any serious point<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he might breathe his spirit out of him.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Finally, Virgil in the play is nominated by
C&aelig;sar to act as judge between Horace and
his libellers, and he advises the administration
of purging pills to the offenders."</p>

<p>This neat little chain of evidence would
have no weak link, if it were not for a passage
in the play, "The Return from Parnassus,"<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
acted by the students in St. John's College
the same year, 1601. In this there is a dialogue
between Shakespeare's fellow-actors,
Burbage and Kempe. Speaking of the University
dramatists, Kempe says:</p>

<p>"Why here's our fellow Shakespeare puts
them all down; aye, and Ben Jonson, too.
O! that Ben Jonson is a pestilent fellow. He
brought up Horace, giving the poets a pill;
but our fellow Shakespeare hath given him
a purge that made him bewray his credit."
Burbage continues, "He is a shrewd fellow
indeed." This has, of course, been taken to
mean that Shakespeare was actively against
Jonson in the Dramatists' and Actors' war.
But as everything else points, as we have
seen, to the contrary, one accepts gladly the
loophole of escape offered by Mr. Lee.
"The words quoted from 'The Return from
Parnassus' hardly admit of a literal interpretation.
Probably the 'purge' that Shakespeare
was alleged by the author of 'The
Return from Parnassus' to have given Jonson
meant no more than that Shakespeare had
signally outstripped Jonson in popular esteem."
That this was an actual fact is proved
by the lines of Leonard Digges, an admiring
contemporary of Shakespeare's, printed in the
1640 edition of Shakespeare's poems, com<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>paring
"Julius C&aelig;sar" and Jonson's play
"Cataline:"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"So have I seen when C&aelig;sar would appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the stage at half-sword parley were<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brutus and Cassius&mdash;oh, how the audience<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were ravish'd, with what wonder they went thence;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When some new day they would not brook a line<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of tedious, though well-labored, Cataline."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This reminds one of the famous witticism
attributed to Eudymion Porter that "Shakespeare
was sent from Heaven and Ben from
College."</p>

<p>If Jonson's criticisms of Shakespeare's work
were sometime not wholly appreciative, the
fact may be set down to the distinction between
the two here so humorously indicated.
"A Winter's Tale" and the "Tempest" both
called forth some sarcasms from Jonson,
the first for its error about the Coast of Bohemia
which Shakespeare borrowed from
Greene. Jonson wrote in the Induction to
"Bartholemew Fair;" "If there be never a
servant-monster in the Fair, who can help it
he says? Nor a nest of Antics. He is loth
to make nature afraid in his plays like those
that beget Tales, Tempests, and such like
Drolleries." The allusions here are very evidently
to Caliban and the satyrs who figure in<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
the sheep-shearing feast in "A Winter's Tale."
The worst blast of all, however, occurs in
Jonson's "Timber," but the blows are evidently
given with a loving hand. He writes
"I remember, the players have often mentioned
it as an honor to Shakespeare that, in his
writing, whatsoever he penn'd, hee never
blotted out line. My answer hath beene,
would he had blotted a thousand;&mdash;which
they thought a malevolent speech. I had not
told posterity this, but for their ignorance
who choose that circumstance to commend
their friend by wherein he most faulted; and
to justifie mine owne candor,&mdash;for I lov'd
the man, and doe honor his memory, on
this side idolatry, as much as any. Hee was,
indeed, honest, and of an open and free nature;
had an excellent phantasie; brave notions
and gentle expressions; wherein hee
flow'd with that facility that sometime it was
necessary he should be stop'd;&mdash;<i>sufflaminandus
erat</i>, as Augustus said of Haterius. His
wit was in his owne power;&mdash;would the rule
of it had beene so too! Many times he fell
into those things, could not escape laughter;
as when he said in the person of C&aelig;sar, one
speaking to him,&mdash;C&aelig;sar thou dost me wrong;
hee replyed,&mdash;C&aelig;sar did never wrong but
with just cause; and such like; which were<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
ridiculous. But hee redeemed his vices with
his virtues. There was ever more in him to
be praysed then to be pardoned."</p>

<p>And even this criticism is altogether controverted
by the wholly eulogistic lines Jonson
wrote for the First Folio edition of <a name='TC_4'></a><ins title="Was 'Shakesspeare'">Shakespeare</ins>
printed in 1623, "To the memory of
my beloved, The Author Mr. William Shakespeare
and what he hath left us."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>For the same edition he also wrote the
following lines for the portrait reproduced in
this volume, which it is safe to regard as the
Shakespeare Ben Jonson remembered:</p>

<p><span class="i30">&nbsp;</span><a name='TC_5'></a><ins title="Was 'B. I.'">B. J.</ins>"</p>

<p>Shakespeare's talk in "At the <a name='TC_6'></a><ins title="Added single quotes">'Mermaid'</ins>"
grows out of the supposition, not touched upon<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
until the very last line that Ben Jonson had been
calling him "Next Poet," a supposition quite
justifiable in the light of Ben's praises of him.
The poem also reflects the love and admiration
in which Shakespeare the man was held
by all who have left any record of their impressions
of him. As for the portraiture of
the poet's attitude of mind, it is deduced indirectly
from his work. That he did not
desire to become "Next Poet" may be argued
from the fact that after his first outburst of
poem and sonnet writing in the manner of the
poets of the age, he gave up the career of
gentleman-poet to devote himself wholly to
the more independent if not so socially distinguished
one of actor-playwright. "Venus
and Adonis" and "Lucrece" were the only
poems of his published under his supervision
and the only works with the dedication to a
patron such as it was customary to write at
that time.</p>

<p>I have before me as I write the recent Clarendon
Press fac-similes of "Venus and Adonis"
and "Lucrece," published respectively in 1593
and 1594,&mdash;beautiful little quartos with exquisitely
artistic designs in the title-pages,
headpieces and initials; altogether worthy of
a poet who might have designs upon Fame.
The dedication to the first reads:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
"<span class="smcap">to the right honorable</span><br />
Henry Wriothesley, Earle of Southampton<br />
and Baron of Litchfield</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Right Honourable, I know not how I shall
offend in dedicating my unpolisht lines to your

<p class="center">

<p>The second reads:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">

To whom I wish long life still lengthened
with all happinesse.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">
Your Lordships in all duety.<br />
<span class="in4 smcap">William Shakespeare."</span></p>

<p>No more after this does Shakespeare appear
in the light of a poet with a patron. Even
the sonnets, some of which evidently celebrate
Southampton, were issued by a piratical
publisher without Shakespeare's consent, while
his plays found their way into print at the
hands of other pirates who cribbed them from
stage copies.</p>

<p>Such hints as these have been worked up
by Browning into a consistent characterization
of a man who regards himself as having
foregone his chances of laureateship or "Next
Poet" by devoting himself to a form of
literary art which would not appeal to the
powers that be as fitting him for any such position.
Such honors he claims do not go to<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
the dramatic poet, who has never allowed the
world to slip inside his breast, but has simply
portrayed the joy and the sorrow of life as he
saw it around him, and with an art which turns
even sorrow into beauty.&mdash;"Do I stoop? I
pluck a posy, do I stand and stare? all's
blue;"&mdash;but to the subjective, introspective
poet, out of tune with himself and with the
universe. The allusions Shakespeare makes
to the last "King" are not very definite, but,
on the whole, they fit Edmund Spenser, whose
poems from first to last are dedicated to people
of distinction in court circles. His work,
moreover, is full of wailing and woe in various
keys, and also full of self-revelation. He allowed
the world to slip inside his breast upon
almost every occasion, and perhaps he may
be said to have bought "his laurel," for it
was no doubt extremely gratifying to Queen
Elizabeth to see herself in the guise of the
Faerie Queene, and even his dedication of the
"Faerie Queene" to her, used as she was to flattery,
must have been as music in her ears.
"To the most high, mightie, and magnificent
Empresse, renouned for piety, vertue, and all
gratious government, Elizabeth, by the Grace
of God, Queene of England, Frahnce, and
Ireland and of Virginia. Defender of the
Faith, &amp;c. Her most humble servant Edmund<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
Spenser doth in all humilitie, Dedicate, present,
and consecrate These his labours, To
live with the eternity of her Fame." The
next year Spenser received a pension from the
crown of fifty pounds per annum.</p>

<p>It is a careful touch on Browning's part to
use the phrase "Next Poet," for the "laureateship"
at that time was not a recognized
official position. The term, "laureate," seems
to have been used to designate poets who had
attained fame and Royal favor, since Nash
speaks of Spenser in his "Supplication of
Piers Pennilesse" the same year the "Faerie
Queene" was published as next laureate.</p>

<p>The first really officially appointed Poet
Laureate was Ben Jonson, himself, who in
either 1616 or 1619 received the post from
James I., later ratified by Charles I., who
increased the annuity to one hundred pounds
a year and a butt of wine from the King's
cellars.</p>

<p>Probably the allusion "Your Pilgrim" in the
twelfth stanza of "At the Mermaid" is to
"The Return from Parnassus" in which the
pilgrims to Parnassus who figure in an earlier
play "The Pilgrimage to Parnassus" discover
the world to be about as dismal a place
as it is described in this stanza.</p>

<p>At first sight it might seem that the position<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
taken by Shakespeare in the poem is almost
too modest, yet upon second thoughts it will
be remembered that though Shakespeare had
a tremendous following among the people,
attested by the frequency with which his
plays were acted; that though there are instances
of his being highly appreciated by
contemporaries of importance; that though
his plays were given before the Queen, he
did not have the universal acceptance among
learned and court circles which was accorded
to Spenser.</p>

<p>It is quite fitting that the scene should be
set in the "Mermaid." No record exists to
show that Shakespeare was ever there, it is
true, but the "Mermaid" was a favorite haunt
of Ben Jonson and his circle of wits, whose
meetings there were immortalized by Beaumont
in his poetical letter to Jonson:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"What things have we seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Done at the Mermaid? heard words that have been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So nimble and so full of subtle flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if that every one from whence they came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had meant to put his whole wit in a jest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And had resolved to live a fool the rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his dull life."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Add to this what Fuller wrote in his
"Worthies," 1662, "Many were the wit-combats
betwixt him and Ben Jonson, which<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
two I behold like a Spanish great galleon
and an English man-of-war; Master Jonson
(like the former) was built far higher in learning,
solid but slow in his performances.
Shakespeare, with the English man-of-war,
lesser in bulk, but lighter in sailing, could
turn with all tides, tack about, and take advantage
of all winds by the quickness of his wit
and invention," and there is sufficient poetic
warrant for the "Mermaid" setting.</p>

<p>The final touch is given in the hint that all
the time Shakespeare is aware of his own
greatness, perhaps to be recognized by a
future age.</p>

has done with the material.</p>

<p>brings one face to face with the interminable
controversies upon the autobiographical significance
of Shakespeare's Sonnets. As volumes
upon the subject have been written,
it is not possible even adequately to review
the various theories here. The controversialists
may be broadly divided into those
who read complicated autobiographical details
into the sonnets, those who scout the
idea of their being autobiographical at all, and
those who take a middle ground. Of the
first there are two factions: one of these
believes that the opening sonnets were addressed
to Lord William Herbert, Earl of
Pembroke, and the other that they were addressed
to Shakespeare's patron, the Earl of
Southampton. The first theory dates back
as far as 1832 when it was started by James
Boaden, a journalist and the biographer of<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
Kemble and Mrs. Siddons. This theory has
had many supporters and is associated to-day
with the name of Thomas Tyler, who, in his
edition of the Sonnets published in 1890,
claimed to have identified the dark lady of
the Sonnets with a lady of the Court, Mary
Fitton and the mistress of the Earl of Pembroke.
The theory, like most things of the
sort, has its fascinations, and few people can
read the Sonnets without being more or less
impressed by it. It is based, however, upon
a supposition so unlikely that it may be said
to be proved incorrect, namely, that the dedication
of the Sonnets to their "Onlie Begettor,
Mr. W.&nbsp;H." is intended for "Mr. William
Herbert." There was a Mr. William Hall,
later a master printer, and the friend of
Thomas Thorpe, the publisher of the Sonnets,
who is much more likely to be the person
meant. Lord Herbert was far too important a
person to be addressed as Mr. W.&nbsp;H. As Mr.
Lee points out, when Thorpe did dedicate
books to Herbert he was careful to give full
prominence to the titles and distinction of his
patron. The Sonnets as we have already
seen were not published with Shakespeare's
sanction. In those days the author had no
protection, and if a manuscript fell into the
hands of a printer he could print it if he felt<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
so disposed. Mr. William Hall was in the
habit of looking out for manuscripts and before
he became a printer, in 1606, had one
published by Southwell of which he himself
wrote the dedication, to the "Vertuous Gentleman,
Mathew Saunders, Esquire W.&nbsp;H.
wisheth, with long life, a prosperous achievement
of his good desires." "There is little
doubt," writes Mr. Lee, "that the W.&nbsp;H. of
the Southwell volume was Mr. William Hall,
who, when he procured that manuscript for
publication, was an humble auxiliary in the
publishing army." To sum up in Mr. Lee's
words his interesting and convincing chapter
on "Thomas Thorpe and Mr. 'W.&nbsp;H.'"
"'Mr. W.&nbsp;H.,' whom Thorpe described as the
'only begetter of these ensuing sonnets,' was
in all probability the acquirer or procurer
of the manuscript, who, figuratively speaking,
brought the book into being either by
first placing the manuscript in Thorpe's
hands or by pointing out the means by which
a copy might be acquired. To assign such
significance to the word 'begetter' was entirely
in Thorpe's vein. Thorpe described
his r&ocirc;le in the piratical enterprise of the
'Sonnets' as that of 'the well-wishing adventurer
in setting forth,' <i>i.e.</i>, the hopeful speculator
in the scheme. 'Mr. W.&nbsp;H.' doubtless<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
played the almost equally important part&mdash;one
as well known then as now in commercial
operations&mdash;of the 'vender' of the property
to be exploited."</p>

<p>The Southampton theory is reared into a
fine air-castle by Gerald Massey in his lengthy
book on the Sonnets&mdash;truly entertaining
reading but too ingenious to be convincing.</p>

<p>Finally Mr. Lee in his book looks at the
subject in an unbiased and perfectly sane way.
He thinks the opening Sonnets are to the Earl
of Southampton, known to be <a name='TC_7'></a><ins title="Was 'Shakepeare's'">Shakespeare's</ins>
patron, but he warns us that exaggerated devotion
was the hall-mark of the Sonnets of
the age, and therefore what Shakespeare
says of his young patron in these Sonnets
need not be taken too literally as expressing
the poet's sentiments, though he admits there
may be a note of genuine feeling in them.
Also he thinks that some of the sonnets reflecting
moods of melancholy or a sense of
sin may reveal the writer's inner consciousness.
Possibly, too, the story of the "dark
lady" may have some basis in fact, though he
insists, "There is no clue to the lady's identity,
and speculation on the topic is useless."
Furthermore, he thinks it doubtful whether
all the words in these Sonnets are to be
taken with the seriousness implied, the affair<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
probably belonging only to the annals of gallantry.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the poem that Browning
took the uncompromisingly non-autobiographical
view of the Sonnets. In this
stand present authoritative opinion would not
justify him, but it speaks well for his insight
and sympathy that he was not fascinated by the
William Herbert theory which, at the time he
wrote the poem, was very much in the air.</p>

<p>In "Shop" is given, in a way, the obverse
side of the idea. If it is proved that
the dramatic poet does not allow himself to
appear in his work, the step toward regarding
him as having no individuality aside from
his work is an easy one. The allusions in
the poem to the mercenariness of the "Shop-Keeper"
seem to hit at the criticisms of Shakespeare's
thrift, which enabled him to buy a
home in his native place and retire there to
live some years before the end of his life. In
some quarters it has been customary to regard
Shakespeare as devoting himself to dramatic
literature in order to make money, as if this
were a terrible slur on his character. The superiority
of such an independent spirit over
that of those who constantly sought patrons
was quite manifest to Browning's mind or he
would not have written this sarcastic bit of<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
symbolism, between the lines of which can
be read that Browning was on Shakespeare's
side.</p>

<p>These poems are valuable not only for
furnishing an interesting interpretation of
Shakespeare's character as a man and artist,
but for the glimpses they give into Browning's
stand toward his own art. He wished
to be regarded primarily as a dramatic artist,
presenting and interpreting the souls of his
characters, and he must have felt keenly the
stupid attitude which insisted always in reading
"Browning's Philosophy" into all his
poems. The fact that his objective material
was of the soul rather than of the external
actions of life has no doubt lent force to the
supposition that Browning himself can be
seen in everything he writes. It is true, nevertheless,
that while much of his work is Shakespearian
in its dramatic intensity, he had too
forceful a philosophy of life to keep it from
sometimes coming to the front. Besides he<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
has written many things avowedly personal
as this chapter amply illustrates.</p>

<p>To what intensity of feeling Browning could
rise when contemplating the genius of Shakespeare
is revealed in his direct and outspoken
tribute. Here there breathes an almost reverential
attitude toward the one supremely great
man he has ventured to portray.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="subtitle">A CRUCIAL PERIOD IN ENGLISH HISTORY</p>

<p class="dropcapq"><small>"</small><span class="drop">W</span><span class="dcap">hom</span> the gods destroy they first
make mad." Of no one in English
history is this truer than of King Charles I.
Just at a time when the nation was feeling
the strength of its wings both in Church and
State, when individuals were claiming the
right to freedom of conscience in their form
of worship and the people were growing more
insistent for the recognition of their ancient
rights and liberties, secured to them, in the
first place, by the Magna Charta,&mdash;just at
this time looms up the obstruction of a King
so imbued with the defunct ideal of the divine
right of Kings that he is blind to the tendencies
of the age. What wonder, then, if
the swirling waters of discontent should rise
higher and higher until he became engulfed
in their fury.</p>

<p>The history of the reign of Charles I. is
one full of involved details, yet the broader
aspects of it, the great events which chiseled
into shape the future of England stand out<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
in bold relief in front of a background of
interminable bickerings. There was constant
quarreling between the factions within the
English church, and between the Protestants
and the Catholics, complicated by the discontent
of the people and at times the nobles
because of the autocratic, vacillating policy
of the King.</p>

<p>Among these epoch-bringing events were
the emergence of the Puritans from the
chaos of internecine church squabbles, the
determined raising of the voice of the people
in the Long Parliament, where King and
people finally came to an open clash in the
impeachment of the King's most devoted
minister, Wentworth, Earl Strafford, by Pym,
the great leader in the House of Commons,
ending in Strafford's execution; the Grand
Remonstrance, which sounded in no uncertain
tones the tocsin of the coming revolution; and
finally the King's impeachment of Pym,
Hampden, Holles, Hazelrigg and Strode, one
of the many ill-advised moves of this Monarch
which at once precipitated the Revolution.</p>

<p>These cataclysms at home were further
intensified by the Scottish Invasion and the
Irish Rebellion.</p>

<p class="caption">Charles I in Scene of Impeachment</p>
</div>

<p>It is not surprising that Browning should<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
have been attracted to this period of English
history, when he contemplated the writing of
a play on an English subject. His liberty-loving
mind would naturally find congenial
occupation in depicting this great English
struggle for liberty. Yet the hero of the play
is not Pym, the leader of the people, but
<a name='TC_8'></a><ins title="Added comma after Strafford">Strafford,</ins> the supporter of the King. The
dramatic reasons are sufficient to account for
this. Strafford's career was picturesque and
tragic and his personality so striking that more
than one interpretation of his remarkable life
is possible.</p>

<p>The interpretation will differ according to
whether one is partisan in hatred or admiration
of his character and policy, or possesses
the larger quality of sympathetic appreciation
of the man and the problems with which
he had to deal. Any one coming to judge him
in this latter spirit would undoubtedly perceive
all the fine points in Strafford's nature and
would balance these against his theories of
government to the better understanding of
this extraordinary man.</p>

<p>It is almost needless to say that Browning's
perception of Strafford's character was
penetrating and sympathetic. Strafford's devotion
to his King had in it not only the
element of loyalty to the liege, but an element<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
of personal love which would make an especial
appeal to Browning. He, in consequence,
seizes upon this trait as the key-note of his
portrayal of Strafford.</p>

<p>The play is, on the whole, accurate in its
historical details, though the poet's imagination
has added many a flying buttress to the
structure.</p>

<p>Forster's lives of the English Statesmen in
Lardner's Cyclop&aelig;dia furnished plenty of
material, and he was besides familiar with
some if not all of Forster's materials for the
lives. One of the interesting surprises in
connection with Browning's literary career
was the fact divulged some years ago that he
had actually helped Forster in the preparation
of the Life of Strafford. Indeed it is
thought that he wrote it almost entirely from
the notes of Forster. Dr. Furnivall first called
attention to this, and later the life of Strafford
was reprinted as "Robert Browning's
Prose Life of Strafford."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In his Forewords
to this volume, Dr. Furnivall, who, among
many other claims to distinction, was the
president of the "London Browning Society,"
writes, "Three times during his life
did Browning speak to me about his prose
'Life of Strafford.' The first time he said<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
only&mdash;in the course of chat&mdash;that very few
people had any idea of how much he had
helped John Forster in it. The second time
he told me at length that one day he went to
see Forster and found him very ill, and anxious
about the 'Life of Strafford,' which he had
promised to write at once, to complete a
volume of 'Lives of Eminent British Statesmen'
for Lardner's 'Cabinet Cyclop&aelig;dia.'
Forster had finished the 'Life of Eliot'&mdash;the
first in the volume&mdash;and had just begun
that of Strafford, for which he had made full
collections and extracts; but illness had come
on, he couldn't work, the book ought to be
completed forthwith, as it was due in the
serial issue of volumes; what <i>was</i> he to do?
'Oh,' said Browning, 'don't trouble about it.
I'll take your papers and do it for you.'
Forster thanked his young friend heartily,
Browning put the Strafford papers under his
arm, walked off, worked hard, finished the
Life, and it came out to time in 1836, to
Forster's great relief, and passed under his
name." Professor Gardiner, the historian, was
of the opinion from internal evidence that the
Life was more Browning's than Forster's.
He said to Furnivall, "It is not a historian's
conception of the character but a poet's. I
am certain that it's not Forster's. Yes, it<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
makes mistakes in facts and dates, but, it has
got the man&mdash;in the main." In this opinion
Furnivall concurs. Of the last paragraph in
the history he exclaims, "I could swear it
was Browning's":&mdash;The paragraph in question
sums up the character of Strafford and is
interesting in this connection, as giving hints,
though not the complete picture of the Strafford
of the Drama.</p>

<p>"A great lesson is written in the life of this
truly extraordinary person. In the career of
Strafford is to be sought the justification of
the world's 'appeal from tyranny to God.'
In him Despotism had at length obtained an
instrument with mind to comprehend, and
resolution to act upon, her principles in their
length and breadth,&mdash;and enough of her
purposes were effected by him, to enable mankind
to 'see as from a tower the end of all.'
I cannot discern one false step in Strafford's
public conduct, one glimpse of a recognition
of an alien principle, one instance of a dereliction
of the law of his being, which can come
in to dispute the decisive result of the experiment,
or explain away its failure. The least
vivid fancy will have no difficulty in taking
up the interrupted design, and by wholly
enfeebling, or materially emboldening, the
insignificant nature of Charles; and by accord<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>ing
some half-dozen years of immunity to the
'fretted tenement' of Strafford's 'fiery <a name='TC_9'></a><ins title="Added end quote">soul'</ins>,&mdash;contemplate
then, for itself, the perfect
realization of the scheme of 'making the prince
the most absolute lord in Christendom.'
That done,&mdash;let it pursue the same course
with respect to Eliot's noble imaginings, or
to young Vane's dreamy aspirings, and apply
in like manner a fit machinery to the working
out the projects which made the dungeon of
the one a holy place, and sustained the other
in his self-imposed exile.&mdash;The result is great
and decisive! It establishes, in renewed force,
those principles of political conduct which
have endured, and must continue to endure,
'like truth from age to age.'" The history,
on the whole, lacks the grasp in the portrayal
of Wentworth to be found in the drama.
C.&nbsp;H. Firth, commenting upon this says truly,
"One might almost say that in the first,
Strafford was represented as he appeared to
his opponents, and in the second as he appeared
to himself; or that, having painted
Strafford as he was, Browning painted him
again as he wished to be. In the biography
Strafford is exhibited as a man of rare gifts
and noble qualities; yet in his political capacity,
merely the conscious, the devoted tool
of a tyrant. In the tragedy, on the other<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
hand, Strafford is the champion of the King's
will against the people's, but yet looks forward
to the ultimate reconciliation of Charles
and his subjects, and strives for it after his
own fashion. He loves the master he serves,
and dies for him, but when the end comes he
can proudly answer his accusers, 'I have
loved England too.'"</p>

<p>The play opens at the important moment of
Wentworth's return to London from Ireland,
where for some time he had been governor.
The occasion of his return, according to
Gardiner, was a personal quarrel with the
Chancellor Loftus, of Ireland. Both men
were allowed to come to England to plead their
cause, which resulted in the victory of Wentworth.
In the play Pym says, "Ay, the Court
gives out His own concerns have brought him
back: I know 'tis the King calls him." The
authority for this remark is found in the
Forster-Browning Life. "In the danger threatened
by the Scots' Covenant, Wentworth was
Charles's only hope; the King sent for him, saying
he desired his personal counsel and attendance.
He wrote: 'The Scots' Covenant begins
to spread too far, yet, for all this, I will not
have you take notice that I have sent for you,
but pretend some other occasion of business.'"
Certain it is that from this time Wentworth<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
became the most trusted counsellor of Charles,
that is, as far as Charles was capable of trusting
any one. The condition of affairs to
which Wentworth returned is brought out in
the play in a thoroughly alive and human
manner. We are introduced to the principal
actors in the struggle for their rights and
privileges against the government of Charles
meeting in a house near Whitehall. Among
the "great-hearted" men are Hampden, Hollis,
the younger Vane, Rudyard, Fiennes&mdash;all
leaders in the "Faction,"&mdash;Presbyterians,
Loudon and other members of the Scots' commissioners.
A bit of history has been drawn
upon for this opening scene, for according
to the Forster-Browning Life, "There is no
doubt that a close correspondence with the
Scotch commissioners, headed by Lords Loudon
and Dumferling, was entered into under
the management of Pym and Hampden.
Whenever necessity obliged the meetings to
be held in London, they took place at Pym's
house in Gray's Inn Lane." In the talk between
these men the political situation in
England at the time from the point of view
of the liberal party is brought vividly before
the reader.</p>

<p>There has been no Parliament in England
for ten years, hence the people have had no<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
say in the direction of the government. The
growing dissatisfaction of the people at being
thus deprived of their rights focussed itself
upon the question of "ship-money." The
taxes levied by the King for the maintainance
of a fleet were loudly objected to upon all
sides. That a fleet was a necessary means
of protection in those threatening times is not
to be doubted, but the objections of the people
were grounded upon the fact that the King
levied these taxes upon his own authority.
"Ship-money, it was loudly declared," says
Gardiner, "was undeniably a tax, and the ancient
customs of the realm, recently embodied
in the Petition of Right, had announced with
no doubtful voice that no tax could be levied
without consent of Parliament. Even this
objection was not the full measure of the evil.
If Charles could take this money without the
consent of Parliament, he need not, unless
some unforeseen emergency arose, ever summon
a Parliament again. The true question
at issue was whether Parliament formed
an integral part of the Constitution or not."
Other taxes were objected to on the same
grounds, and the more determined the King
was not to summon a Parliament, the greater
became the political ferment.</p>

<p class="caption">Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford</p>
</div>

<p>At the same time the religious ferment was<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
centering itself upon hatred of Laud, the
Archbishop of Canterbury. His policy was
to silence opposition to the methods of worship
then followed by the Church of England,
by the terrors of the Star Chamber. The
Puritans were smarting under the sentence
which had been passed upon the three pamphleteers,
William Prynne, Henry Burton,
and John Bastwick, who had expressed their
opinions of the practises of the church with
great outspokenness. Prynne called upon
pious King Charles "to do justice on the
whole Episcopal order by which he had been
robbed of the love of God and of his people,
and which aimed at plucking the crown from
his head, that they might set it on their own
ambitious pates." Burton hinted that "the
sooner the office of the Bishops was abolished
the better it would be for the nation." Bastwick,
who had been brought up in the straitest
principles of Puritanism, had ended his pamphlet
"<i>Flagellum Pontificis</i>," with this outburst,
"Take notice, so far am I from flying
or fearing, as I resolve to make war against
the Beast, and every hint of Antichrist, all
the days of my life. If I die in that battle,
so much the sooner I shall be sent in a chariot
of triumph to heaven; and when I come there,
I will, with those that are under the altar cry,<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
'How long, Lord, holy and true, dost Thou
not judge and avenge our blood upon them
that dwell upon the earth?'"</p>

<p>These men were called before the Star
Chamber upon a charge of libel. The sentence
was a foregone conclusion, and was so
outrageous that its result could only be the
strengthening of opposition. The "muckworm"
Cottington, as Browning calls him,
suggested the sentence which was carried out.
The men were condemned to lose their ears,
to pay a fine of &pound;5000 each, and to be imprisoned
for the remainder of their lives in
the castles of Carnarvon, Launceston, and
Lancaster. Finch, not satisfied with this,
added the savage wish that Prynne should be
branded on the cheek with the letters S.&nbsp;L.,
to stand for "seditious libeller," and this was
also done.</p>

<p>The account of the execution of this sentence
is almost too horrible to read. Some
one who recorded the scene wrote, "The
humours of the people were various; some
wept, some laughed, and some were very
reserved." Prynne, whose sufferings had been
greatest for he had been burned as well as
having his ears taken off, was yet able to indulge
in a grim piece of humor touching the
letters S.&nbsp;L. branded on his cheeks. He<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
called them "Stigmata Laudis," the "Scars of
Laud," on his way back to prison. Popular
demonstrations in favor of the prisoners were
made all along the road when they were taken
to their respective prisons, where they were
allowed neither pen, ink nor books. Fearful
lest they might somehow still disseminate their
heretical doctrines to the outer world, the
council removed them to still more distant
prisons, in the Scilly Isles, in Guernsey and
in Jersey. Retaliation against this treatment
found open expression. "A copy of the Star
Chamber decree was nailed to a board. Its
corners were cut off as the ears of Laud's
victims had been cut off at Westminster. A
broad ink mark was drawn round Laud's
name. An inscription declared that 'The
man that puts the saints of God into a pillory
of wood stands here in a pillory of ink!'"</p>

<p>Things were brought to a crisis in Scotland
also, through hatred of Laud and the new
prayer-book. The <a name='TC_10'></a><ins title="Capitalized King">King</ins>, upon his visit to
Scotland, had been shocked at the slovenly
appearance and the slovenly ritual of the
Scottish Church, which reflected strongly survivals
of the Presbyterianism of an earlier
time. The King wrote to the Scottish Bishops
soon after his return to England: "We, tendering
the good and peace of that Church by<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
having good and decent order and discipline
observed therein, whereby religion and God's
worship may increase, and considering that
there is nothing more defective in that Church
than the want of a Book of Common Prayer
and uniform service to be kept in all the
churches thereof, and the want of canons for
the uniformity of the same, we are hereby
pleased to authorise you as the representative
body of that Church, and do herewith will and
require you to condescend upon a form of
Church service to be used therein, and to set
down the canons for the uniformity of the
discipline thereof." Laud, who as Archbishop
of Canterbury had no jurisdiction over
Scottish Bishops, put his finger into the pie
as secretary of the King. As Gardiner says,
"He conveyed instructions to the Bishops,
remonstrated with proceedings which shocked
his sense of order, and held out prospects of
advancement to the zealous. Scotchmen naturally
took offense. They did not trouble
themselves to distinguish between the secretary
and the archbishop. They simply said
that the Pope of Canterbury was as bad as
the Pope of Rome."</p>

<p>The upshot of it all was that in May, 1637,
the "new Prayer-book" was sent to Scotland,
and every minister was ordered to buy two<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
copies on pain of outlawry. Riots followed. It
was finally decided that it must be settled
once for all whether a King had any right to
change the forms of worship without the
sanction of a legislative assembly. Then
came the Scottish Covenant which declared
the intention of the signers to uphold religious
liberty. The account of the signing of this
covenant is one of the most impressive episodes
in all history. The Covenant was carried on
the 28th of February, 1638, to the Grey Friars'
Church to which all the gentlemen present in
Edinburgh had been summoned. The scene
has been most sympathetically described by
Gardiner.</p>

<p>"At four o'clock in the grey winter evening,
the noblemen, the Earl of Sutherland leading
the way began to sign. Then came the gentlemen,
one after the other until nearly eight.
The next day the ministers were called on to
testify their approval, and nearly three hundred
signatures were obtained before night. The
Commissioners of the boroughs signed at the
same time.</p>

<p>"On the third day the people of Edinburgh
were called on to attest their devotion to the
cause which was represented by the Covenant.
Tradition long loved to tell how the honored
parchment, carried back to the Grey Friars,<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
was laid out on a tombstone in the churchyard,
whilst weeping multitudes pressed round
in numbers too great to be contained in any
building. There are moments when the stern
Scottish nature breaks out into an enthusiasm
less passionate, but more enduring, than the
frenzy of a Southern race. As each man and
woman stepped forward in turn, with the
right hand raised to heaven before the pen
was grasped, every one there present knew
that there would be no flinching amongst that
band of brothers till their religion was safe
from intrusive violence.</p>

<p>"Modern narrators may well turn their attention
to the picturesqueness of the scene,
to the dark rocks of the Castle crag over
against the churchyard, and to the earnest
faces around. The men of the seventeenth
century had no thought to spare for the
earth beneath or for the sky above. What
they saw was their country's faith trodden
under foot, what they felt was the joy of those
who had been long led astray, and had now
returned to the Shepherd and Bishop of their
souls."</p>

<p>Such were the conditions that brought on
the Scotch war, neither Charles nor Wentworth
being wise enough to make concessions
to the Covenanters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
The grievances against the King's Minister
Wentworth are in this opening scene shown
as being aggravated by the fact that the men
of the "Faction" regard him as a deserter
from their cause, Pym, himself being one of
the number who is loth to think Wentworth
stands for the King's policy.</p>

<p>The historical ground for the assumption
lies in the fact that Wentworth was one of
the leaders of the opposition in the Parliament
of 1628.</p>

<p>The reason for this was largely personal,
because of Buckingham's treatment of him.
Wentworth had refused to take part in the
collection of the forced loan of 1626, and was
dismissed from his official posts in consequence.
When he further refused to subscribe
to that loan himself he was imprisoned
in the Marshalsea and at Depford. Regarding
himself as personally attacked by Buckingham,
he joined the opposition. Yet, as
Firth points out, "fiercely as he attacked the
King's ministers, he was careful to exonerate
the King." He concludes his list of grievances
by saying, "This hath not been done
by the King, but by projectors." Again,
"Whether we shall look upon the King or his
people, it did never more behove this great
physician the parliament, to effect a true<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
consent amongst the parties than now. Both
are injured, both to be cured. By one and
the same thing hath the King and people
been hurt. I speak truly both for the interest
of the King and the people."</p>

<p>His intention was to find some means of
cooperation which would leave the people
their liberty and yet give the crown its prerogative,
"Let us make what laws we can,
there must&mdash;nay, there will be a trust left
in the crown."</p>

<p>It will be seen by any unbiased critic that
Wentworth was only half for the people even
at this time. On the other hand, it is not
astonishing that men, heart and soul for the
people, should consider Wentworth's subsequent
complete devotion to the cause of the
King sufficient to brand him as an apostate.
The fact that he received so many official
dignities from the King also leant color to the
supposition that personal ambition was a
leading motive with him. With true dramatic
instinct Browning has centered this
feeling and made the most of it in the attitude
of Pym's party, while he offsets it later
in the play by showing us the reality of the
man Strafford.</p>

<p>There is no very authentic source for the
idea also brought out in this first scene that<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
Strafford and Pym had been warm personal
friends. The story is told by Dr. James
Welwood, one of the physicians of William
III., who, in the year 1700, published a
volume entitled "Memoirs, of the most material
transactions in England for the last
hundred years preceding the Revolution of
1688." Without mentioning any source he
tells the following story; "There had been a
long and intimate friendship between Mr.
Pym and him [Wentworth], and they had
gone hand in hand in everything in the
House of Commons. But when Sir Thomas
Wentworth was upon making his peace with
the Court, he sent to Pym to meet him
alone at Greenwich; where he began in a set
speech to sound Mr. Pym about the dangers
they were like to run by the courses
they were in; and what advantages they
might have if they would but listen to some
offers which would probably be made them
from the Court. Pym understanding his
speech stopped him short with this expression:
'You need not use all this art to tell me
you have a mind to leave us; but remember
what I tell you, you are going to be undone.
But remember, that though you leave us now
I will never leave you while your head is
upon your shoulders.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
Though only a tradition this was entirely
too useful a suggestion not to be used. The
intensity of the situation between the leaders
on opposite sides is enhanced tenfold by
bringing into the field a personal sentiment.</p>

<p>The attitude of Pym's followers is reflected
again in their opinion of Wentworth's Irish
rule. Although Wentworth's policy seemed
to be successful in Ireland, the very fact of its
success would condemn it in the eyes of the
popular party; besides later developments revealed
its weaknesses. How it appeared to
the eyes of a non-fanatical observer at this
time may be gathered from the following letter
of Sir Thomas Roe to the Queen of Bohemia,
written in 1634.</p>

<p>"The Lord Deputy of Ireland doth great
wonders, and governs like a King, and hath
taught that Kingdom to show us an example
of envy, by having parliaments, and knowing
wisely how to use them; for they have given
the King six subsidies, which will arise to
&pound;240,000, and they are like to have the liberty
we contended for, and grace from his Majesty
worth their gift double; and which is worth
much more, the honor of good intelligence
and love between the King and people, which
I would to God our great wits had had eyes<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
to see. This is a great service, and to give
your Majesty a character of the man,&mdash;he is
severe abroad and in business, and sweet in
private conversation; retired in his friendships,
but very firm; a terrible judge and a strong
enemy; a servant violently zealous in his
Master's ends, and not negligent of his own;
one that will have what he will, and though
of great reason, he can make his will greater
when it may serve him; affecting glory by a
seeming contempt; one that cannot stay long
in the middle region of fortune, being entreprenant;
but will either be the greatest man
in England, or much less than he is; lastly,
one that may (and his nature lies fit for it,
for he is ambitious to do what others will not),
do your Majesty very great service, if you can
make him."</p>

<p>In order to be in sympathy with the play
throughout and especially with the first scene
all this historical background must be kept
in mind, for the talk gives no direct information,
it merely in an absolutely dramatic
fashion reveals the feelings and opinions of
the men upon the situation, just as friends at
a dinner party might discuss one of our own
less strenuous political situations&mdash;all present
being perfectly familiar with the issues at
stake.</p>

<p>In the second scene of the first act, the man
upon whom the popular party has been heaping
opprobrium appears to speak for himself.
Again the historical background must be
known in order that the whole drift of the
scene may be understood. Wentworth is
talking with Lady Carlisle, a woman celebrated
for her beauty and her wit, and fond
of having friendships with great men. Various
opinions of this beautiful woman have
been expressed by those who knew her.
"Her beauty," writes one, "brought her
adorers of all ranks, courtiers, and poets, and
statesmen; but she remained untouched by
their worship." Sir Toby Mathews who pre<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>fixed
to a collection of letters published in
1660 "A character of the most excellent Lady,
Lucy, Countess of Carlisle," writes that she
will "freely discourse of love, and hear both the
fancies and powers of it; but if you will needs
bring it within knowledge, and boldly direct
it to herself, she is likely to divert the discourse,
or, at least, seem not to understand
it. By which you may know her humour,
and her justice; for since she cannot love in
earnest she would have nothing from love."
According to him she filled her mind "with
gallant fancies, and high and elevated
thoughts," and "her wit being most eminent
among the rest of her great abilities," even
the conversation of those most famed for it
was affected. Quite another view of her is
given in a letter of Voiture's written to Mr.
Gordon on leaving England in 1623.</p>

<p>"In one human being you let me see more
treasures than there are there [the Tower], and
even more lions and leopards. It will not be
difficult for you to guess after this that I
speak of the Countess of Carlisle. For there
is nobody else of whom all this good and evil
can be said. No matter how dangerous it is
to let the memory dwell upon her, I have not,
so far, been able to keep mine from it, and,
quite honestly, I would not give the picture of<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
her that lingers in my mind, for all the loveliest
things I have seen in my life. I must
confess that she is an enchanting personality,
and there would not be a woman under heaven
so worthy of affection, if she only knew what
it was, and if she had as sensitive a nature
as she has a reasonable mind. But with the
temperament we know she possesses, there is
nothing to be said except that she is the most
lovable of all things not good, and the most
delightful poison that nature ever concocted."
Browning himself says he first sketched her
character from Mathews, but finding that
rather artificial, he used Voiture and Waller,
who referred to her as the "bright Carlisle of
the Court of Heaven." It should be remembered
that she had become a widow and was
considerably older at the time of her friendship
with Wentworth than when Voiture
wrote of her, and was probably better balanced,
and truly worthy of Wentworth's own
appreciation of her when he wrote, "A nobler
nor a more intelligent friendship did I never
meet with in my life." A passage in a letter
to Laud indicates that Wentworth was well
aware of the practical advantage in having
such a friend as Lady Carlisle at Court. "I
judge her ladyship very considerable. She is
often in place, and extremely well skilled how<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
to speak with advantage and spirit for those
friends she professeth unto, which will not
be many. There is this further in her disposition,
she will not seem to be the person
she is not, an ingenuity I have always observed
and honoured her for."</p>

<p>It is something of a shock to learn that even
before the Wentworth episode was well over,
she became a friend of his bitterest foe, Pym.
Gardiner sums up her character in as fair a
way as any one,&mdash;and not at all inconsistent
with Browning's portrayal of her.</p>

<p>"Lady Carlisle had now been for many
years a widow. She had long been the reigning
beauty at Court, and she loved to mingle
political intrigue with social intercourse. For
politics as a serious occupation she had no
aptitude; but, in middle age, she felt a woman's
pride in attaching to herself the strong heads
by which the world was ruled, as she had
attached to herself in youth, the witty courtier
or the agile dancer. It was worth a statesman's
while to cultivate her acquaintance.
She could make him a power in society as
well as in Council, could worm out a secret
which it behoved him to know, and could convey
to others his suggestions with assured fidelity.
The calumny which treated Strafford,
as it afterwards treated Pym, as her accepted<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
lover, may be safely disregarded. But there
can be no doubt that purely personal motives
attached her both to Strafford and Pym.
For Strafford's theory of Monarchical government
she cared as little as she cared for Pym's
theory of Parliamentary government. It may
be, too, that some mingled feeling may have
arisen in Strafford's breast. It was something
to have an ally at Court ready at all
times to plead his cause with gay enthusiasm,
to warn him of hidden dangers, and to offer
him the thread of that labyrinth which, under
the name of 'the Queen's side,' was such a
mystery to him. It was something, too, no
doubt, that this advocate was not a grey haired
statesman, but a woman, in spite of growing
years, of winning grace and sparkling vivacity
of eye and tongue."</p>

<p>Strafford, himself, Browning brings before
us, ill, and worn out with responsibility as he
was upon his return to England at this time.
Carlisle tactfully lets him know how he will
have to face criticisms from other councillors
about the King, and how even the confidence
of the fickle King cannot be relied upon. In
his conference with the King in this scene,
Strafford, at last, wins the confidence of the
King as history relates. Wentworth, horrified
at the way in which a war with Scotland has
been precipitated, carries his point, that Parliaments
should be called in Ireland and England.
This will give time for preparation,
and at the same time an opportunity of convincing
the people that the war is justified by
Scotland's treason, so causing them willingly
to grant subsidies for the expense of the war.
To turn from the play to history, Commissioners
from the Scottish Parliament, the Earls
of Loudon and Dumferling had arrived in
London to ask that the acts of the Scottish
Parliament might receive confirmation from
the King. This question was referred to a
committee of eight Privy Councillors. Propositions
were made to put the Scotch Commissioners
in prison; however, the King
finally decided to dismiss them without treating
with them. Scottish indignation of course
ran high at this proceeding, and here Wentworth
stepped in and won the King to his
policy of ruling Scotland directly from England.
"He insisted," writes Gardiner, "that
a Parliament, and a Parliament alone, was
the remedy fitted for the occasion. Laud and
Hamilton gave him their support. He carried
his point with the Committee. What was of
more importance he carried it with the King."
And as one writer expressed it the Lords were
of the opinion that "his Majesty should make<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
trial of that once more, that so he might leave
his people without excuse, and have where
withal to justify himself to God and the
world that in his own inclination he desired
the old way; but that if his people should
not cheerfully, according to their duties,
meet him in that, especially in this exigent
when his kingdom and person are in apparent
danger, the world might see he is
forced, contrary to his own inclination, to
use extraordinary means rather than, by
the peevishness of some few factious spirits,
to suffer his state and government to be
lost."</p>

<p>In the play as in history, Charles now confers
upon Wentworth an Earldom. Shortly
after this the King "was prepared," says
Gardiner, "to confer upon his faithful Minister
that token of his confidence which he
had twice refused before. On January 12,
Wentworth received the Earldom of Strafford,
and a week later he exchanged the title of
Lord-Deputy of Ireland for the higher dignity
of Lord-Lieutenant."</p>

<p>In his conference with Pym, Strafford who,
in talking to Carlisle, had shown a slight
wavering toward the popular party, because
of finding himself so surrounded by difficulties,
stands firm; this episode is a striking<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
working up of the tradition of the friendship
between these two men.</p>

<p>The influence of the Queen upon Charles
is the last strand in this tangled skein of human
destiny brought out by Browning in
the scene. The Parliament that Wentworth
wants she is afraid of lest it should ask for
a renewal of the persecution of the Catholics.
The vacillating Charles, in an instant, is ready
to repudiate his interview with Wentworth,
and act only to please the Queen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
In the second act, the historical episode,
which pervades the act is the assembling and
the dissolution of the Short Parliament. Only
the salient points of the political situation have
been seized upon by Browning. As in the
first act, the popular party in private conclave
is introduced. From the talk it is gathered
that feeling runs high against Strafford, by
whose advice the Parliament had been called,
because of the exorbitant demands made upon
it for money to support an army, this army to
crush Scotland whose cause was so nearly like
its own. The popular party or the Faction
had supposed the Parliament would be a
means for the redressing of its long list of
grievances which had been accumulating during
the years since the last Parliament had
been held. Instead of that the Commons
was deliberately informed by Charles that
there would be no discussions of its demands
until it had granted the subsidies for
which it had been asked. The play gives
one a much more lively sense of the indignant
feelings of the duped men than can possibly
be gained by reading many more pages
of history with its endless minor details. Upon
this gathering, Pym suddenly enters again,
and to the reproaches of him for his belief in
Strafford, makes the reply that the Parliament<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
has been dissolved, the King has cast Strafford
off forever, and henceforth Strafford will be on
their side,&mdash;a conclusion not warranted by
history, and, of course, found out to be erroneous
by Pym and his followers in the next
scene. Again there is the dramatic need to
emphasize the human side of life even in an
essentially political play, by showing that Pym's
friendship and loyalty to Wentworth were no
uncertain elements in his character. The moment
it could be proved beyond a doubt that
Wentworth was in the eyes of Pym, England's
enemy, that moment Pym knew it would become
his painful duty to crush Wentworth utterly,
therefore Pym had for his own conscience'
sake to make the uttermost trial of his faith.</p>

<p>The second scene, as in the first act, brings
out the other side. It is in the main true to
history though much condensed. History relates
that after the Short Parliament was
dissolved, "voices were raised at Whitehall
in condemnation of Strafford." His policy
of raising subsidies from the Parliament having
failed, criticisms would, of course, be
made upon his having pushed ahead a war
without the proper means of sustaining it.
Charles himself was also frightened by the
manifestations of popular discontent and failed
to uphold Wentworth in his policy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
Northumberland had been appointed commander-in-chief
of the army, but besides having
little heart for an enterprise so badly prepared
for, he was ill in bed and could not take
command of the army, so the King appointed
Strafford in his place. A hint of Strafford
as he appears in this scene may be taken from
Clarendon who writes "The earl of Strafford
was scarce recovered from a great sickness,
yet was willing to undertake the charge out
of pure indignation to see how few men were
forward to serve the King with that vigor of
mind they ought to do; but knowing well the
malicious designs which were contrived against
himself, he would rather serve as lieutenant-general
under the earl of Northumberland,
than that he should resign his commission:
and so, with and under that qualification, he
made all possible haste towards the north before
he had strength enough for the journey."
Browning makes the King tell Strafford in
this interview that he has dissolved the Parliament.
He represents Strafford as horrified
by the news and driven in this extremity to
suggest the desperate measure of debasing
the coinage as a means of obtaining funds.
Strafford actually counseled this, when all
else failed, namely, the proposed loan from
the city, and one from the Spanish govern<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>ment,
but, according to history, he himself
voted for the dissolution of Parliament, though
the play is accurate in laying the necessity of
the dissolution at the door of old Vane. It
was truly his ill-judged vehemence, for, not
able to brook the arguments of the Commons,
"He rose," says Gardiner, "to state that the
King would accept nothing less than the twelve
subsidies which he had demanded in his
message. Upon this the Committee broke up
without coming to a resolution, postponing
further consideration of the matter to the
following day." The next morning the King
who had called his councillors together early
"announced his intention of proceeding to
a dissolution. Strafford, who arrived late,
begged that the question might first be seriously
discussed, and that the opinions of the
Councillors, who were also members of the
Lower House, might first be heard. Vane
declared that there was no hope that the Commons
'would give one penny.' On this the
votes were taken. Northumberland and Holland
were alone in wishing to avert a dissolution.
Supported by the rest of the Council
the King hurried to the House of Lords and
dissolved Parliament."</p>

<p>Wholly imaginary is the episode in this scene
where Pym and his followers break in upon<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
the interview of Wentworth and the King.
Just at the climax of Wentworth's sorrowful
rage at the King's treatment of him, they come
to claim Wentworth for their side.</p>

</div>

<p>During the third act, the long Parliament
is in session, and Pym is making his great
speech impeaching Wentworth.</p>

<p>The conditions of affairs at the time of this
Parliament were well-nigh desperate for Charles
and Wentworth. Things had not gone well<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
with the Scottish war and Wentworth was falling
more and more into disfavor. England
was now threatened with a Scottish invasion.
Still, even with this danger to face it was impossible
to raise money to support the army.
The English had a suspicion that the Scotch
cause was their own. The universal demand
for a Parliament could no longer be ignored;
the <a name='TC_15'></a><ins title="Capitalized King">King</ins>, therefore, summoned it to meet on
the third of November. As Firth observes,
"To Strafford this meant ruin, but he hardly
realized the greatness of the danger in which
he stood. On October 8, the Scotch Commissioners
in a public paper denounced him
as an incendiary, and declared that they meant
to insist on his punishment.</p>

<p>"As soon as the Parliament opened Charles
discovered that it was necessary for his service
to have Strafford again by his side, and
summoned him to London. There is evidence
that his friends urged him to pass over
to Ireland where the army rested at his devotion,
or to transport himself to foreign Kingdoms
till fairer weather here should invite
him home. The Marquis of Hamilton advised
him to fly, but as Hamilton told the
King, the Earl was too great-hearted to fear.
Though conscious of the peril of obedience,
he set out to London to stand by his Master."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
The enmity of the Court party to Strafford is
touched upon in the first scene, and in the
second, Strafford's return, unsuspecting of the
great blow that awaits him. He had indeed
meditated a blow on his own part. According
to Firth, he felt that "One desperate
resource remained. The intrigues of the parliamentary
leaders with the Scots had come
to Strafford's knowledge, and he had determined
to impeach them of high treason. He
could prove that Pym and his friends had
secretly communicated with the rebels, and
invited them to bring a Scottish army into
England. Strafford arrived in London on
Monday, November 9, 1640, and spent Tuesday
in resting after his journey. On the
morning of Wednesday the 11th, he took his
seat in the House of Lords, but did not strike
the blow." Upon that day he was impeached
of high treason by Pym. Gardiner's account
here has much the same dramatic force as
the play.</p>

<p>"Followed by a crowd of approving members,
Pym carried up the message. Whilst
the Lords were still debating on this unusual
request for imprisonment before the charge
had been set forth, the news of the impeachment
was carried to Strafford. 'I will go,'
he proudly said 'and look my accusers in the<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
face.' With haughty mien and scowling brow
he strode up the floor of the House to his place
of honor. There were those amongst the Peers
who had no wish to allow him to speak, lest he
should accuse them of complicity with the
Scots. The Lords, as a body, felt even more
personally aggrieved by his method of government
than the Commons. Shouts of 'Withdraw!
withdraw!' rose from every side. As
soon as he was gone an order was passed
sequestering the Lord-Lieutenant from his
place in the House and committing him to the
custody of the Gentleman Usher. He was then
called in and bidden to kneel whilst the order
was read. He asked permission to speak, but
his request was sternly refused. Maxwell,
the Usher of the Black Rod, took from him his
sword, and conducted him out of the House.
The crowd outside gazed pitilessly on the
fallen minister, 'No man capping to him,
before whom that morning the greatest in
England would have stood <a name='TC_16'></a><ins title="Matching the original: leaving it hyphenated">dis-covered</ins>.' 'What
is the matter?' they asked. 'A small matter,
I warrant you,' replied Strafford with
forced levity. 'Yes, indeed,' answered a bystander,
'high treason is a small matter.'"</p>

<p>This passage brings up the scene in a
manner so similar to that of the play, it is
safe to say that Gardiner was here <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>influenced
by Browning, the history having been
written many years after the play.</p>

<p>The history of the fourth act deals with
further episodes of Strafford's trial, especially
with the change in the procedure from Impeachment
to a Bill of Attainder against
Strafford. The details of this great trial are
complicated and cannot be followed in all their
ramifications here. There was danger that
the Impeachment would not go through.
Strafford, himself, felt confident that in law
his actions could not be found treasonable.</p>

<p>After Strafford's brilliant defense of himself,
it was decided to bring in a Bill of Attainder.
New evidence against Strafford con<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>tained
in some notes which the younger Vane
had found among his father's papers were
used to strengthen the charge of treason.
In these notes Strafford had advised the King
to act "loose and absolved from all rules of
government," and had reminded him that
there was an army in Ireland, ready to reduce
the Kingdom. These notes were found by
the merest accident. The younger Vane who
had just been knighted and was about to be
married, borrowed his father's keys in order
to look up some law papers. In his search
he fell upon these notes taken at a committee
that met immediately after the dissolution of
the short Parliament. He made a copy and
carried it to Pym who also made a copy.</p>

<p>According to Baillie, the "secret" of the
change from the Impeachment to the Bill was
"to prevent the hearing of the Earl's lawyers,
who give out that there is no law yet in force
whereby he can be condemned to die for
aught yet objected against him, and therefore
their intent by this Bill to supply the
defect of the laws therein." To this may be
added the opinion of a member of the Commons.
"If the House of Commons proceeds
to demand judgment of the Lords, without
doubt they will acquit him, there being no
law extant whereby to condemn him of treason.<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Wherefore the Commons are determined to
desert the Lord's judicature, and to proceed
against him by Bill of Attainder, whereby he
shall be adjudged to death upon a treason
now to be declared."</p>

<p>One of the chief results in this change of
procedure, emphasized by Browning in an intense
scene between Pym and Charles was
that it altered entirely the King's attitude
towards Strafford's trial. As Baillie expresses
it, "Had the Commons gone on in the former
way of pursuit, the King might have been a
patient, and only beheld the striking off of
Strafford's head; but now they have put them
on a Bill which will force the King either to
be our agent and formal voicer to his death,
or else do the world knows not what."</p>

<p>For the sake of a gain in dramatic power,
Browning has once more departed from history
by making Pym the moving power in
the Bill of Attainder, and Hampden in favor
of it; while in reality they were opposed to
the change in procedure, and believed that
the Impeachment could have been carried
through.</p>

<p>The relentless, scourging force of Pym in
the play, pursuing the arch-foe of England as
he regarded Wentworth to the death, once he
is convinced that England's welfare demands<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
it, would have been weakened had he been
represented in favor of the policy which was
abandoned, instead of with the policy that
succeeded. But Pym is made to intimate
that he will abandon the Bill unless the King
gives his word that he will ratify it, and
further, Pym declares, should he not ratify
the Bill his next step will be against the King
himself.</p>

<p>In the last act Browning has drawn upon
his imagination more than in any other part
of the play. Strafford in prison in the Tower
is the center around which all the other elements
of the drama are made to revolve. A
glimpse, the first, of the man in a purely
human capacity is given in the second scene
with Strafford and his children. From all
accounts little Anne was a precocious child
and Browning has sketched her accordingly.
The scene is like a gleam of sunshine in the
gathering gloom.</p>

<p>The genuine grief felt by the historical
Charles over the part he played in the ruin
of Strafford is brought out in an interview
between Strafford and Charles, who is represented
as coming disguised to the prison.
Strafford who has been hoping for pardon<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
from the King learns from Hollis, in the King's
presence, that the King has signed his death
warrant. He receives this shock with the
remark which history attributes to him.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"Put not your trust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In princes, neither in the sons of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In whom is no salvation!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>History tells us of two efforts to rescue
Strafford. One of these was an attempt to
bribe Balfour to allow him to escape from
the tower. This hint the Poet has worked
up into the episode of Charles, calling Balfour
and begging him to go at once to Parliament,
to say he will grant all demands, and that he
chooses to pardon Strafford. History, however,
does not say that Lady Carlisle was
implicated in any plan for the rescue of
Strafford, of which Browning makes so much.
According to Gardiner, she was by this time
bestowing her favors upon Pym. Devotion
to the truth here on Browning's part would
have completely ruined the inner unity of the
play. Carlisle, the woman ready to devote
herself to Strafford's utmost need, while Strafford
is more or less indifferent to her is the
artistic compliment of Strafford the man devoted
to the unresponsive King. The failure
of the escape through Pym's intervention is a<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
final dramatic climax bringing face to face
not so much the two individual men as the
two principles of government for which England
was warring, the Monarchical and the
Parliamentary. To the last, Strafford is loyal
to the King and the Kingly idea, while Pym
crushing his human feelings under foot, calmly
contemplates the sacrifice not only of Strafford,
but even of the King, if England's need
demand it.</p>

<p>In this supreme moment of agony when
Strafford and Pym meet face to face both men
are made to realize an abiding love for each
other beneath all their earthly differences.
"A great poet of our own day," writes Gardiner,
"clothing the reconciling spirit of the
nineteenth century in words which never could
have been spoken in the seventeenth, has
breathed a high wish. On his page an imaginary
Pym, recalling an imaginary friendship,
looks forward hopefully to a reunion in a
better and brighter world."</p>

<p>A lively picture of Cavalier sentiment is
given in the "Cavalier Tunes"&mdash;which
ought to furnish conclusive proof that
Browning does not always put himself into
his work. They may be compared with the
words set to Avison's march given in the last

<p>Though not illustrative of the subject in
hand, "Martin Relph" is included here on
account of the glimpse it gives of an episode,
interesting in English History, though devoid
of serious consequences, since it marked the
final abortive struggle of a dying cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
An imaginary incident of the rebellion in
the time of George II., forms the background
of "Martin Relph," the point of the story
being the life-long agony of reproach suffered
by Martin who let his envy and jealousy conquer
him at a crucial moment. The history
of the attempt of Charles Edward to get back
the crown of England, supported by a few
thousand Highlanders, of his final defeat at
the Battle of Culloden, and of the decay henceforth
of Jacobitism, needs no telling. The
treatment of spies as herein shown is a common-place
of war-times, but that a reprieve
exonerating the accused should be prevented
from reaching its destination in time through
the jealousy of the only person who saw it
coming gives the episode a tragic touch lifting
it into an atmosphere of peculiar individual
pathos.</p>

<h3>MARTIN RELPH</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<i><span class="i0">My grandfather says he remembers he saw, when a youngster long ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a bright May day, a strange old man, with a beard as white as snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stand on the hill outside our town like a monument of woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, striking his bare bald head the while, sob out the reason&mdash;so!<br /></span></i>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If I last as long at Methuselah I shall never forgive myself:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Get you behind the man I am now, you man that I used to be!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What can have sewed my mouth up, set me a-stare, all eyes, no tongue?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">People have urged "You visit a scare too hard on a lad so young!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You were taken aback, poor boy," they urge, "no time to regain your wits:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides it had maybe cost you life." Ay, there is the cap which fits!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, cap me, the coward,&mdash;thus! No fear! A cuff on the brow does good:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The feel of it hinders a worm inside which bores at the brain for food.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See now, there certainly seems excuse: for a moment, I trust, dear friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fault was but folly, no fault of mine, or if mine, I have made amends!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For, every day that is first of May, on the hill-top, here stand I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Martin Relph, and I strike my brow, and publish the reason why,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When there gathers a crowd to mock the fool. No fool, friends, since the bite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a worm inside is worse to bear: pray God I have balked him quite!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I'll tell you. Certainly much excuse! It came of the way they cooped<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet you needs must be meddling, folk like you, not foes&mdash;so much the worse!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The many and loyal should keep themselves unmixed with the few perverse.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Is the counsel hard to follow? I gave it you plainly a month ago,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Not a month since in we quietly marched: a week, and they had the news,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From a list complete of our rank and file to a note of our caps and shoes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All about all we did and all we were doing and like to do!<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Is it 'Dearie, how much I miss your mouth!'&mdash;good natural stuff, she pens?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some sprinkle of that, for a blind, of course: with talk about cocks and hens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How 'robin has built on the apple-tree, and our creeper which came to grief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the frost, we feared, is twining afresh round casement in famous leaf.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But all for a blind! She soon glides frank into 'Horrid the place is grown<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And Farmer Giles has a tribe to house, and lodging will be to seek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the second Company sure to come ('tis whispered) on Monday week.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And so to the end of the chapter! There! The murder you see, was out:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But treachery meets a just reward, no matter if fools malign!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"That traitors had played us false, was proved&mdash;sent news which fell so pat:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With a case of the kind, when a woman's in fault: we soldiers need nerves of steel!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"So, I gave her a chance, despatched post-haste a message to Vincent Parkes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom she wrote to; easy to find he was, since one of the King's own clerks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ay, kept by the King's own gold in the town close by where the rebels camp:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Next week is now: does he come? Not he! Clean gone, our clerk, in a trice!<br /></span>

<p>This poem, on an incident in Clive's life, is
also included on account of its English historical
setting.</p>

<p>The remarkable career of Robert Clive
cannot be gone into here. Suffice it to refresh
one's memory with a few principal
events of his life. He was born in Shopshire
in 1725. He entered the service of the East
India Company at eighteen and was sent to
Madras. Here, on account of his falling into
debt, and being in danger of losing his situation,
he twice tried to shoot himself. The
pistol failed to go off, however, and he became
impressed with the idea that some great
destiny was awaiting him. His feeling was
fully realized as his subsequent career in
India shows. At twenty-seven, when he returned
to England he had made the English
the first military power in India. On his
return to India (1755-59) he took a further
step and secured for the English a political<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
supremacy. Finally, on his last visit, he
crowned his earlier exploits by putting the
English dominance on a sounder basis of
integrity than it had before been.</p>

<p>The incident related in the poem by the
old man, Browning heard from Mrs. Jameson,
who had shortly before heard it from Macaulay
at Lansdowne House. Macaulay mentions
it in his essay: "Of his personal courage he
had, while still a writer [clerk] given signal
proof by a desperate duel with a military
bully who was the terror of Fort St. David."</p>

<p>The old gentleman in the poem evidently
mixed up his dates slightly, for he says this
incident occurred when Clive was twenty-one,
and he represents him as committing suicide
twenty-five years afterwards. Clive was actually
forty-nine when he took his own life.</p>

<span class="i0">Sorriest sample, if you take the kitchen's estimate for fame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the man Clive&mdash;he fought Plassy, spoiled the clever foreign game,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conquered and annexed and Englished!<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="i24" style="display: inline;">&nbsp;</span>Never mind! As o'er my punch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(You away) I sit of evenings,&mdash;silence, save for biscuit-crunch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black, unbroken,&mdash;thought grows busy, thrids each pathway of old years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Notes this forthright, that meander, till the long-past life appears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like an outspread map of country plodded through, each mile and rood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once, and well remembered still: I'm startled in my solitude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever and anon by&mdash;what's the sudden mocking light that breaks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On me as I slap the table till no rummer-glass but shakes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I ask&mdash;aloud, I do believe, God help me!&mdash;"Was it thus?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can it be that so I faltered, stopped when just one step for us&mdash;"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Got no end of wealth and honor,&mdash;yet I stood stock still no less?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;"For I was not Clive," you comment: but it needs no Clive to guess<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Louts them&mdash;what avail the thousand, noisy in a smock-frocked ring,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Higher warrant must you show me ere I set one foot before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">T'other in that dark direction, though I stand for evermore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor as Job and meek as Moses. Evermore? No! By-and-by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Job grows rich and Moses valiant, Clive turns out less wise than I.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don't object "Why call him friend, then?" Power is power, my boy, and still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marks a man,&mdash;God's gift magnific, exercised for good or ill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You've your boot now on my hearth-rug, tread what was a tiger's skin:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rarely such a royal monster as I lodged the bullet in!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">True, he murdered half a village, so his own death came to pass;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still, for size and beauty, cunning, courage&mdash;ah, the brute he was!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, that Clive,&mdash;that youth, that greenhorn, that quill-driving clerk, in fine,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sustained a siege in Arcot.... But the world knows! Pass the wine.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Late supreme, encroaching slowly, surely, threatened to absorb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ray by ray its noontide brilliance,&mdash;friendship might, with steadier eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drawing near, bear what had burned else, now no blaze&mdash;all majesty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too much bee's-wing floats my figure? Well, suppose a castle's new:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None presume to climb its ramparts, none find foothold sure for shoe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt those squares and squares of granite plating the impervious pile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As his scale-mail's warty iron cuirasses a crocodile.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Scrambling up by crack and crevice, every cockney prates about<br /></span>

<p class="subtitle">SOCIAL ASPECTS OF ENGLISH LIFE</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">Browning</span>'s poetry presents no such
complete panorama of phases of social
life in England as it does of those in Italy,
perhaps, because there is a poise and solidity
about the English character which does not
lend itself to so great a variety of mood as
one may find in the peculiarly artistic temperament
of the Italians, especially those of
the Renaissance period. Even such irregular
proceedings as murders have their philosophical
after-claps which show their usefulness
in the divine scheme of things, while unfortunate
love affairs work such beneficent results
in character that they are shorn of much of
their tragedy of sorrow. There is quite a
group of love-lyrics with no definite setting
that might be put down as English in temper.
It does not require much imagination to think
of the lover who sings so lofty a strain in "One
Way of Love" as English:&mdash;</p>

<p>"James Lee's Wife" is also English in
temper as the English name indicates suffi<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>ciently,
though the scene is laid out of England.
This wife has her agony over the faithless
husband, but she plans vengeance against
neither him nor the other women who attract
him. She realizes that his nature is not a
deep and serious one like her own, and in her
highest reach she sees that her own nature has
been lifted up by means of her true and loyal
feeling, that this gain to herself is her reward,
or will be in some future state. The stanzas
giving this thought are among the most beautiful
in the poem.</p>

<p>Two of the longer poems have distinctly
English settings: "A Blot in the Scutcheon"
and "The Inn Album;" while, of the shorter
ones, "Ned Bratts" has an English theme,
and "Halbert and Hob" though not founded
upon an English story has been given an English
<i>mis en sc&egrave;ne</i> by Browning.</p>

<p>In the "Blot," we get a glimpse of
Eighteenth Century aristocratic England.
The estate over which Lord Tresham presided
was one of those typical country kingdoms,
which have for centuries been so conspicuous
a feature of English life, and which
through the assemblies of the great, often
gathered within their walls, wielded potent
influences upon political life. The play opens
with the talk of a group of retainers, such as
formed the household of these lordly establishments.
It was not a rare thing for the servants
of the great to be admitted into intimacy
with the family, as was the case with
Gerard. They were often people of a superior
grade, hardly to be classed with servants
in the sense unfortunately given to that
word to-day.</p>

<p>Besides the house and the park which
figure in the play, such an estate had
many acres of land devoted to agriculture&mdash;some
of it, called the demesne, which was<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
cultivated for the benefit of the owner, and
some land held in villeinage which the unfree
tenants, called villeins, were allowed to till
for themselves. All this land might be in
one large tract, or the demesne might be separate
from the other. Mertoun speaks of their
demesnes touching each other. Over the
villeins presided the Bailiff, who kept strict
watch to see that they performed their work
punctually. His duties were numerous, for
he directed the ploughing, sowing and reaping,
gave out the seed, watched the harvest, gathered
and looked after the stock and horses.
A church, a mill and an inn were often
included in such an estate.</p>

<p>Pride in their ancient lineage was, of course,
common to noble families, though probably
few of them could boast as Tresham did that
there was no blot in their escutcheon. Some
writers have even declared that most of the
nobles are descended from tradesmen. According
to one of these "The great bulk of
our peerage is comparatively modern, so far
as the titles go; but it is not the less noble that
it has been recruited to so large an extent from
the ranks of honorable industry. In olden
times, the wealth and commerce of London,
conducted as it was by energetic and enterprising
men was a prolific source of peerages.<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
Thus, the earldom of Cornwallis was founded
by Thomas Cornwallis, the Cheapside merchant;
that of Essex by William Capel, the
draper; and that of Craven by William Craven,
the merchant tailor. The modern Earl of
Warwick is not descended from 'the King-maker,'
but from William Greville, the
woolstapler; whilst the modern Dukes of Northumberland
find their head, not in the Percies,
but in Hugh Smithson, a respectable London
apothecary. The founders of the families of
Dartmouth, Radnor, Ducie, and Pomfret were
respectively a skinner, a silk manufacturer,
a merchant tailor, and a Calais merchant;
whilst the founders of the peerages of Tankerville,
Dormer, and Coventry were mercers.
The ancestors of Earl Romney, and Lord
Dudley and Ward, were goldsmiths and jewelers;
and Lord Dacres was a banker in the
reign of Charles I., as Lord Overstone is in
that of Queen Victoria. Edward Osborne,
the founder of the dukedom of Leeds, was
apprentice to William Hewet, a rich cloth
worker on London Bridge, whose only daughter
he courageously rescued from drowning, by
leaping into the Thames after her, and eventually
married. Among other peerages founded
by trade are those of Fitzwilliam, Leigh, Petre,
Cowper, Darnley, Hill, and Carrington."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
Perhaps the imaginary house of Tresham
may be said to find its closest counterpart in
the Sidney family, for many generations
owners of Penshurst, and with a traditional
character according to which the men were
all brave and the women were all pure. Sir
Philip Sidney was himself the type of all the
virtues of the family, while his father's care
for his proper bringing up was not unlike
Tresham's for Mildred. In the words of a
recent writer: "The most famous scion of
this Kentish house was above all things, the
moral and intellectual product of Penshurst
Place. In the park may still be seen an
avenue of trees, under which the father, in
his afternoon walks with the boy, tested his
recollection of the morning's lessons conned
with the <a name='TC_25'></a><ins title="Changed comma to period">tutor.</ins> There, too, it was that he
impressed on the lad those maxims for the
conduct of life, afterwards emphasized in the
correspondence still extant among the Penshurst
archives.</p>

<p>"Philip was to begin every day with lifting
up his mind to the Almighty in hearty prayer,
as well as feelingly digesting all he prayed for.
He was also, early or late, to be obedient to
others, so that in due time others might obey
him. The secret of all success lay in a moderate
diet with rare use of wine. A gloomy<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
brow was, however, to be avoided. Rather
should the youth give himself to be merry,
so as not to degenerate from his father. Above
all things should he keep his wit from biting
words, or indeed from too much talk of any
kind. Had not nature ramparted up the
tongue with teeth and the lips with hair as
reins and bridles against the tongue's loose
use. Heeding this, he must be sure to tell
no untruth even in trifles; for that was a
naughty custom, nor could there be a greater
reproach to a gentleman than to be accounted
a liar. <i>Noblesse oblige</i> formed the keynote
of the oral and written precepts with which
the future Sir Philip Sidney was paternally
supplied. By his mother, too, Lady Mary
Dudley, the boy must remember himself to
be of noble blood. Let him beware, therefore,
through sloth and vice, of being accounted
a blemish on his race."</p>

<p>Furthermore, the brotherly and sisterly relations
of Tresham and Mildred are not unlike
those of Sir Philip Sidney and his sister Mary.
They studied and worked together in great
sympathy, broken into only by the tragic fate
of Sir Philip. Although the education of
women in those days was chiefly domestic,
with a smattering of accomplishments, yet
there were exceptional girls who aspired to<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
learning and who became brilliant women.
Mildred under her brother's tutelage bid fare
to be one of this sort.</p>

<p>The ideals of the Sidneys, it is true, were
sixteenth-century ideals. Eighteenth-century
ideals were proverbially low. England, then,
had not recovered from the frivolities inaugurated
after the Restoration. The slackness
and unbelief among the clergy, and the looseness
of morals in society were notorious, but
this degeneration could not have been universal.
There are always a few Noahs and
their families left to repeople the world with
righteousness after a deluge of degeneracy,
and Browning is quite right in his portrayal
of an eighteenth-century knight <i>sans peur et
sans reproche</i> who defends the honor of his
house with his sword, because of his high moral
ideals. Besides, the Methodist revival led by
the Wesleys gained constantly in power. It
affected not only the people of the middle and
lower classes, rescuing them from brutality
of mind and manners, but it affected the established
church for the better, and made its
mark upon the upper classes. "Religion,
long despised and contemned by the titled
and the great" writes Withrow, "began to
receive recognition and support by men high
in the councils of the nation. Many ladies of<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
high rank became devout Christians. A new
element of restraint, compelling at least some
outward respect for the decencies of life and
observances of religion, was felt at court, where
too long corruption and back-stair influence
had sway."</p>

<p>Like all of his kind, no matter what the
century, Tresham is more than delighted at
the thought of an alliance between his house
and the noble house to which Mertoun
belonged. The youth of Mildred was no obstacle,
for marriages were frequently contracted
in those days between young boys and
girls. The writer's English grand-father and
mother were married at the respective ages
of sixteen and fifteen within the boundaries
of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The first two scenes of the play present episodes
thoroughly illustrative of the life lived
by the "quality."</p>

<p>The story of the love of Mildred and Mertoun
is the universally human one, and belongs
to no one country or no one period of
civilization more than another, but the attitude
of all the actors in the tragedy belongs
distinctively to the phase of moral culture
which we saw illustrated in the youth of Sir
Philip Sidney, and is characteristic of English
ways of thinking whenever their moral force
comes uppermost, as for example in the Puritan
thought of the Cromwellian era.</p>

<p>The play is in a sense a problem play,
though to most modern readers the tragedy
of its ending is all too horrible a consequence
of the sin. Dramatically and psychically,
however, the tragedy is much more inevitable
than that of Romeo and Juliet, whose love
one naturally thinks of in the same connection.
The catastrophe in the Shakespeare play is
almost mechanically pushed to its conclusion
through mere external blundering, easily to
have been prevented. Juliet saw clearly where<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
Mildred does not, that loyalty to a deep and
true love should triumph over all minor considerations,
so that in her case the tragedy is,
in no sense, due to her blindness of vision.
In the "Blot," lack of perception of the true
values in life makes it impossible for Mildred
or Tresham to act otherwise than they did.
But having worked out their problem according
to their lights, a new light of a more glorious
day dawns upon them.</p>

<p>The ideal by which Tresham lives and moves
and has his being is that of pride of birth, with
honor and chastity as its watchwords. At
the same time the idol of his life is his sister
Mildred, over whom he has watched with a
father's and mother's care. When the blow
to his ideal comes at the hands of this much
cherished sister, it is not to be wondered at
that his reason almost deserts him. The
greatest agony possible to the human soul is
to have its ideals, the very food which has been
the sustenance of its being, utterly ruined. The
ideal may be a wrong one, or an impartial one,
and through the wrack and ruin may dawn
larger vision, but, unless the nature be a marvelously
developed one the storm that breaks
when an ideal is shattered is overwhelming.</p>

<p>It would be equally true of Mildred that,
nurtured as she had been and as young Eng<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>lish
girls usually are, in great purity, even
ignorance of all things pertaining to life, the
sense of her sin would be so overwhelming as
to blind her to any possible means of expiation
except the most extreme. And indeed
may it not be said that only those who can see
as Mertoun and Guendolen did that genuine
and loyal love is no less love because, in a
conventional sense, it has sinned,&mdash;only those
would acknowledge, as Tresham, indeed, does
after he has murdered Mertoun, how perfect
the love of Mildred and Mertoun was. Sin
flourishes only when insincerity tricks itself
out in the garb of love, and on the whole it is
well that human beings should have an abiding
sense of their own and others insincerity,
and test themselves by their willingness to
acknowledge their love before God and man.
There are many Mildreds but few Mertouns.
It is little wonder that Dickens wrote with such
enthusiasm of this play that he knew no love
like that of Mildred and Mertoun, no passion
like it.</p>

<p>One does not need to discuss whether murders
were possible in English social life. They
are possible in all life at all times as long as
men and women allow their passions to overthrow
their reason. The last act, however,
illustrates the English poise already referred<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
to; Tresham regains his equilibrium with enlarged
vision, his salvation is accomplished,
his soul awakened.</p>

<p>In "Ned Bratts," Browning has given a
striking picture of the influence exerted by
Bunyan upon some of his wicked contemporaries.
The poet took his hints for the
story from Bunyan himself, who tells it as
follows in the "Life and Death of Mr. Badman."</p>

<p>"At a summer assizes holden at Hertford,
while the judge was sitting upon the bench,
comes this old Tod into the Court, clothed in a
green suit, with his leathern girdle in his hand,
his bosom open, and all on a dung sweat, as
if he had run for his life; and being come in,
he spake aloud, as follows: 'My lord,' said
he, 'here is the veriest rogue that breathes upon
the face of the earth. I have been a thief
from a child: when I was but a little one, I
gave myself to rob orchards and to do other
such like wicked things, and I have continued
a thief ever since. My lord, there has not
been a robbery committed these many years,
within so many miles of this place, but I have
either been at it, or privy to it.' The judge
thought the fellow was mad, but after some<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
conference with some of the justices, they
agreed to indict him; and so they did of
several felonious actions; to all of which he
heartily confessed guilty, and so was hanged,
with his wife at the same time."</p>

<p>Browning had the happy thought of placing
this episode in Bedford amid the scenes of
Bunyan's labors and imprisonment. Bunyan,
himself, was tried at the Bedford Assizes upon
the charge of preaching things he should not,
or according to some accounts for preaching
without having been ordained, and was sentenced
to twelve years' imprisonment in the
Bedford Jail. At one time it was thought that
he wrote "Pilgrim's Progress" during this imprisonment,
but Dr. Brown, in his biography
of Bunyan conjectured that this book was not
begun until a later and shorter imprisonment
of 1675-76, in the town prison and toll-house
on Bedford Bridge. Dr. Brown supposes that
the portion of the book written in prison closes
where Christian and Hopeful part from the
shepherds on the Delectable Mountains. "At
that point a break in the narrative is indicated&mdash;'So
I awoke from my dream;' it is resumed
with the words&mdash;'And I slept and dreamed
again, and saw the same two pilgrims going
down the mountains along the highway towards
the city.' Already from the top of an<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
high hill called 'Clear,' the Celestial City was
in view; dangers there were still to be encountered;
but to have reached that high hill
and to have seen something like a gate, and
some of the glory of the place, was an attainment
and an incentive." There Bunyan could
pause. Several years later the pilgrimage of
Christiana was written.</p>

<p>Browning, however, adopts the tradition
that the book was written during the twelve
years' imprisonment, and makes use of the
story of Bunyan's having supported himself
during this time by making tagged shoe-laces.
He brings in, also, the little blind daughter to
whom Bunyan was said to be devoted. The
Poet was evidently under the impression also
that the assizes were held in a courthouse, but
there is good authority for thinking that at
that time they were held in the chapel of
Herne. Nothing remains of this building now,
but it was situated at the southwest corner of
the churchyard of St. Paul, and was spoken
of sometimes as the School-house chapel.</p>

<p>Ned Bratts and his wife did not know, of
course, that they actually lived in the land of
the "Pilgrim's Progress." This has been
pointed out only recently in a fascinating little
book by A.&nbsp;J. Foster of Wootton Vicarage,
Bedfordshire. He has been a pilgrim from<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
Elstow, the village where Bunyan was born
near Bedford, through all the surrounding
country, and has fixed upon many spots
beautiful and otherwise which he believes were
transmuted in Bunyan's imagination into the
House Beautiful, The Delectable Mountains,
Vanity Fair and so on through nearly all the
scenes of Christian's journey.</p>

<p>The House Beautiful he identifies with
Houghton House in the manor of Dame
Ellen's Bury. This is one of the most interesting
of the country houses of England, because
of its connection with Sir Philip Sidney's
sister, Mary Sidney. After the death of her
husband, Lord Pembroke, James I. presented
her with the royal manor of Dame Ellen's
Bury, and under the guidance of Inigo Jones,
it is generally supposed, Houghton House was
built. It is in ruins now and covered with
ivy. Trees have grown within the ruins
themselves. Still it is one of the most beautiful
spots in Bedfordshire. "In Bunyan's
time," Mr. Foster writes, "we may suppose
the northern slope of Houghton Park was a
series of terraces rising one above another,
and laid out in the stiff garden fashion of the
time. A flight of steps, or maybe a steep
path, would lead from one terrace to the next,
and gradually the view over the plain of Bed<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>ford
would reveal itself to the traveler as
he mounted higher and higher."</p>

<p>From Houghton House there is a view of
the Chiltern Hills. Mr. Foster is of the opinion
that Bunyan had this view in mind when he
described Christian as looking from the roof
of the House Beautiful southwards towards
the Delectable Mountains. He writes, "One
of the main roads to London from Bedford,
and the one, moreover, which passes through
Elstow, crosses the hills only a little more
than a mile east of Houghton House, and
Bunyan, in his frequent journeys to London,
no doubt often passed along this road. All in
this direction was, therefore, to him familiar
ground. Many a pleasant walk or ride came
back to him through memory, as he took pen
in hand to describe Hill Difficulty with its
steep path and its arbor, and the House
Beautiful with its guest-chamber, its large
upper room looking eastward, its study and
its armory.</p>

<p>"Many a time did Bunyan, as he journeyed,
look southwards to the blue Chilterns, and
when the time came he placed together all
that he had seen, as the frame in which he
should set his way-faring pilgrim."</p>

<p>Pleasant as it would be to follow with Mr.
Foster his journey through the real scenes of<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
the "Pilgrim's Progress," our main interest
at present is to observe how Browning's
facile imagination has presented the conversion,
through the impression made upon them
by Bunyan's book, of Ned and his wife.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The effect which "Pilgrim's Progress" had
on these two miserable beings, may be taken
as typical of the enormous influence wielded
by Bunyan in his own time. The most innocent
among us had overwhelming qualms in
regard to our sins, as children when we listened
to our mothers read the book. I
remember having confessed some childish peccadillo
that was weighing on my small mind
as the first result of my thoroughly aroused
sense of guilt. In these early years of the
Twentieth Century, such a feeling seems almost
as far removed as the days of Bunyan.
A sense of guilt is not a distinguishing characteristic
of the child of the present day, and
it may also be doubted whether such reprobates
as Ned and his wife would to-day be
affected much if at all by the "Pilgrim's
Progress." There was probably great personal
magnetism in Bunyan himself. We are
told that after his discharge from prison, his<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
popularity as a preacher widened rapidly.
Such vast crowds of people flocked to hear
him that his place of worship had to be enlarged.
He went frequently to London on
week days to deliver addresses in the large
chapel in Southwark which was invariably
thronged with eager worshipers.</p>

<p>Browning's picture of Bunyan shows the
instant effect of his personality upon Tab.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There sat the man, the father. He looked up: what one feels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When heart that leapt to mouth drops down again to heels!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He raised his hand.... Hast seen, when drinking out the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the day, earth grow another something quite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the sun's first stare? I stood a very stone."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And again</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="i20" style="display: inline;">&nbsp;</span>"Then all at once rose he:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His brown hair burst a-spread, his eyes were suns to see:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up went his hands."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is like a clever bit of stage business to
make Ned and Tab use the shoe laces to tie
up the hands of their victims, and to bring
on by this means the meeting between Tab
and Bunyan. Of course, the blind daughter's
part is imaginary, but yet it seems to bring
very vividly before us this well loved child.
Another touch, quite in keeping with the time,<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
is the decision of the Judge that the remarkable
change of heart in Ned and Tab was due
to the piety of King Charles. Like every
one else, however, he was impressed by what
he heard of the Tinker, and inclined to see
what he could do to give him his freedom.
It seems that Bunyan's life in jail was a good
deal lightened by the favor he always inspired.
The story goes that from the first he was in
favor with the jailor, who nearly lost his
place for permitting him on one occasion to
go as far as London. After this he was more
strictly confined, but at last he was often
allowed to visit his family, and remain with
them all night. One night, however, when
he was allowed this liberty Bunyan felt resistlessly
impressed with the propriety of
returning to the prison. He arrived after
the keeper had shut up for the night, much
to the official's surprise. But his impatience
at being untimely disturbed was changed to
thankfulness, when a little after a messenger
came from a neighboring clerical magistrate
to see that the prisoner was safe. "You may
go now when you will" said the jailer; "for
you know better than I can tell you when to
come in again."</p>

<p>Though Bunyan is not primarily the subject

to his genius and to his force of character,
only to be paralleled by Dowden's sympathetic
critique in his "Puritan and Anglican

that it is no book but</p>

<p>Dowden puts in the colder language of criticism.</p>

<p>"The 'Pilgrim's Progress' is a gallery of
portraits, admirably discriminated, and as
convincing in their self-verification as those of
Holbein. His personages live for us as
few figures outside the drama of Shakespeare
live.... All his powers cooperated
harmoniously in creating this book&mdash;his religious
ardor, his human tenderness, his
sense of beauty, nourished by the Scriptures,
his strong common sense, even his gift of
humor. Through his deep seriousness play
the lighter faculties. The whole man presses
into this small volume."</p>

<p>"Halbert and Hob" belongs here merely
for its wild North of England setting. We
may imagine, if we choose, that this wild
father and son dwelt in the beautiful country
of Northumberland, in the North of England,<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
but descriptions of the scenery could add
nothing to the atmosphere of the poem,
for Northumberland is surpassingly lovely.
Doubtless, human beings of this type have
existed in all parts of the globe. At any rate,
these particular human beings were transported
by Browning from Aristotle's "Ethics"
to the North of England. The incident is told
by Aristotle in illustration of the contention
that anger and asperity are more natural than
excessive and unnecessary desires. "Thus
one who was accused of striking his father
said, as an apology for it, that his own
father, and even his grandfather, had struck
his; 'and he also (pointing to his child) will
strike me, when he becomes a man; for it runs
in our family.' A certain person, also, being
dragged by his son, bid him stop at the
door, for he himself had dragged his father as
far as that." The dryness of "Aristotle's
<a name='TC_30'></a><ins title="Was 'checks'">cheeks</ins>" is as usual so enlivened by Browning
that the fate of Halbert and Hob grows
pathetic and comes close to our sympathies.</p>

<h3>HALBERT AND HOB</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here is a thing that happened. Like wild beasts whelped, for den,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a wild part of North England, there lived once two wild men<br /></span><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
<span class="i0">Inhabiting one homestead, neither a hovel nor hut,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time out of mind their birthright: father and son, these&mdash;but&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such a son, such a father! Most wildness by degrees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Softens away: yet, last of their line, the wildest and worst were these.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Criminals, then? Why, no: they did not murder and rob;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, give them a word, they returned a blow&mdash;old Halbert as young Hob:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harsh and fierce of word, rough and savage of deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hated or feared the more&mdash;who knows?&mdash;the genuine wild-beast breed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus were they found by the few sparse folk of the countryside;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But how fared each with other? E'en beasts couch, hide by hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a growling, grudged agreement: so, father and son aye curled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The closelier up in their den because the last of their kind in the world.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still, beast irks beast on occasion. One Christmas night of snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came father and son to words&mdash;such words! more cruel because the blow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To crown each word was wanting, while taunt matched gibe, and curse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Completed with oath in wager, like pastime in hell,&mdash;nay, worse:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For pastime turned to earnest, as up there sprang at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The son at the throat of the father, seized him and held him fast.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
<span class="i0">"Out of this house you go!"&mdash;(there followed a hideous oath)&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"This oven where now we bake, too hot to hold us both!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If there's snow outside, there's coolness: out with you, bide a spell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the drift and save the sexton the charge of a parish shell!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, the old trunk was tough, was solid as stump of oak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Untouched at the core by a thousand years: much less had its seventy broke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One whipcord nerve in the muscly mass from neck to shoulder-blade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the mountainous man, whereon his child's rash hand like a feather weighed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nevertheless at once did the mammoth shut his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drop chin to breast, drop hands to sides, stand stiffened&mdash;arms and thighs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All of a piece&mdash;struck mute, much as a sentry stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Patient to take the enemy's fire: his captain so commands.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whereat the son's wrath flew to fury at such sheer scorn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his puny strength by the giant eld thus acting the babe new-born:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And "Neither will this turn serve!" yelled he. "Out with you! Trundle, log!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you cannot tramp and trudge like a man, try all-fours like a dog!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still the old man stood mute. So, logwise,&mdash;down to floor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pulled from his fireside place, dragged on from hearth to door,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was he pushed, a very log, staircase along, until<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A certain turn in the steps was reached, a yard from the house-door-sill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then the father opened eyes&mdash;each spark of their rage extinct,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Temples, late black, dead-blanched,&mdash;right-hand with left-hand linked,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He faced his son submissive; when slow the accents came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They were strangely mild though his son's rash hand on his neck lay all the same.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hob, on just such a night of a Christmas long ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For such a cause, with such a gesture, did I drag&mdash;so&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father down thus far: but, softening here, I heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A voice in my heart, and stopped: you wait for an outer word.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For your own sake, not mine, soften you too! Untrod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leave this last step we reach, nor brave the finger of God!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I dared not pass its lifting: I did well. I nor blame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor praise you. I stopped here: and, Hob, do you the same!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Straightway the son relaxed his hold of the father's throat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They mounted, side by side, to the room again: no note<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took either of each, no sign made each to either: last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As first, in absolute silence, their Christmas-night they passed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At dawn, the father sate on, dead, in the self-same place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With an outburst blackening still the old bad fighting-face:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the son crouched all a-tremble like any lamb new-yeaned.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When he went to the burial, someone's staff he borrowed&mdash;tottered and leaned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his lips were loose, not locked,&mdash;kept muttering, mumbling. "There!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At his cursing and swearing!" the youngsters cried: but the elders thought "In prayer."<br /></span><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
<span class="i0">A boy threw stones: he picked them up and stored them in his vest.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So tottered, muttered, mumbled he, till he died, perhaps found rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Is there a reason in nature for these hard hearts?" O Lear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That a reason out of nature must turn them soft, seems clear!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the "Inn Album," a degenerate type
of Nineteenth-Century Englishman is dissected
with the keen knife of a surgeon, which
Browning knows so well how to wield. The
villain of this poem was a real personage, a
Lord de Ros, a friend of the Duke of Wellington.
The story belongs to the annals of
crime and is necessarily unpleasant, but in
order to see how Browning has worked up
the episode it is interesting to know the bare
facts as Furnivall gives them in "Notes and
Queries" March 25, 1876. He says "that the
gambling lord showed the portrait of the
lady he had seduced and abandoned and
offered his dupe an introduction to her, as a
bribe to induce him to wait for payment of
the money he had won; that the young gambler
eagerly accepted the offer; and that the
lady committed suicide on hearing of the bargain
between them." Dr. Furnivall heard
the story from some one who well remembered
the sensation it had made in London<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
years ago. In his management of the story,
Browning has intensified the villainy of the
Lord at the same time that he has shown a
possible streak of goodness in him. The
young man, on the other hand, he has made
to be of very good stuff, indeed, notwithstanding
his year of tutelage from the older man.
He makes one radical change in the story as
well as several minor ones. In the poem
the younger man had been in love with the
girl whom the older man had dishonorably
treated, and had never ceased to love her.
Of course, the two men do not know this.
By the advice of the elder man, the younger
one has decided to settle down and marry
his cousin, a charming young girl, who is
also brought upon the scene. The other girl
is represented as having married an old country
parson, who sought a wife simply as a
helpmeet in his work. By thus complicating
the situations, room has been given for subtle
psychic development. The action is all concentrated
into one morning in the parlor of
the old inn, reminding one much of the method
of Ibsen in his plays of grouping his action
about a final catastrophe. At the inn one
is introduced first to the two gamblers in talk,
the young man having won his ten thousand
pounds from the older man, who had intended<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
to fleece him. The inn album plays an important
part in the action, innocent as its
first appearance upon the scene seems to be.
The description of this and the inn parlor
opens the poem.</p>

<p>Circumstantial as the description of this
parlor and the situation of the inn is, it is
impossible to say which out of the many
English inns Browning had in mind. Inns
date back to the days of the Romans, who had
ale-houses along the roads, the most interesting
feature of which was the ivy garland or
wreath of vine-leaves in honor of Bacchus,
wreathed around a hoop at the end of a long
pole to point out the way where good drink
could be had. A curious survival of this in
early English times was the "ale-stake," a
tavern so called because it had a long pole
projecting from the house front wreathed like
the old Roman poles with furze, a garland
of flowers or an ivy wreath. This decoration
was called the "bush," and in time the
London taverners so vied with each other in
their attempt to attract attention by very long
poles and very prominent bushes that in 1375<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
a law was passed according to which all taverners
in the city of London owning ale-stakes
projecting or extending over the King's highway
more than seven feet in length, at the
utmost, should be fined forty pence, and compelled
to remove the sign. Here is the origin,
too, of the proverb, "good wine needs no
bush." In the later development of the inn
the signs lost their Bacchic character and became
most elaborate, often being painted by
artists.</p>

<p>The poet says this inn was the "Something-arms,"
and had perhaps once been a house.
Many inns were the "Something (?) arms"
and certainly many inns had been houses.
One such is the Pounds Bridge Inn on a secluded
road between Speldhurst and Penshurst
in Kent. It was built by the rector of
Penshurst, William Darkenoll, who lived in it
only three years, when it became an inn. The
inn of the poem might have been a combination
in Browning's memory of this and the
"White Horse" at Woolstone, which is described
as a queerly pretty little inn with a
front distantly resembling a Chippendale bureau-bookcase.
"It is tucked away under
the mighty sides of White Horse Hill, Berkshire,
and additionally overhung with trees
and encircled with shrubberies and under-<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>woods,
and is finally situated on a narrow
road that presently leads, as it would seem,
to the end of the known world." So writes
the enthusiastic lover of inns, Charles Harper.
Or, perhaps, since there is a river to be seen
from the inn of the poem the "Swan" at
Sandleford Water, where a foot bridge and a
water splash on the river Enborne mark the
boundaries of Hampshire and Berkshire. Here
"You have the place wholly to yourself, or
share it only with the squirrels and the birds
of the overarching trees." The illustration
given of the Black Bear Inn, Tewksbury, is
a quite typical example of inn architecture,
and may have helped the picture in Browning's
mind, though its situation is not so rural as
that described in the poem.</p>

<p>Inns have, from time immemorial, been the
scenes of romances and tragedies and crimes.
There have been inns like the "Castle" where
the "quality" loved to congregate. The "inn
album" of this establishment had inscribed
in it almost every eighteenth-century name
of any distinction. There have been inns
which were noted as the resort of the wits of
the day. Ben Jonson loved to take "mine
ease in mine inn," and Dr. Johnson declared
that a seat in a tavern chair was the height of
human felicity. "He was thinking," as it has<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
been pertinently put, "not only of a comfortable
sanded parlor, a roaring fire, and
plenty of good cheer and good company, but
also of the circle of humbly appreciative
auditors who gathered round an accepted wit,
hung upon his words, offered themselves as
butts for his ironic or satiric humor, and&mdash;stood
treat." Or there was the inn of
sinister aspect where highwaymen might congregate,
or inns with hosts who let their guests
down through trap-doors in the middle of the
night to rob and murder them&mdash;or is this
only a vague remembrance of a fanciful inn
of Dickens? Then there was the pilgrim's
inn in the days when Chaucerian folks loved
to go on pilgrimages, and in the last century
the cyclists inn, and to-day the inn of the
automobilist. The particular inn in the poem
belongs to the class, rural inn, and in spite of
its pictures by noted masters was "stuffy" as
to the atmosphere.</p>

<p class="caption">An English Inn</p>
</div>

<p>The "inn album" or visitors' book is a
feature of inns. In this country we simply
sign our names in the visitors' book, but the
"album" feature of the visitors' book of an
English inn is its glory and too often its
shame, for as Mr. Harper says, "Bathos,
ineptitude, and lines that refuse to scan are
the stigmata of visitors' book verse. There is<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
no worse poetry on earth than that which
lurks between those covers, or in the pages
of young ladies' albums." He declares that
"The interesting pages of visitors' books are
generally those that are not there, as an
Irishman might say; for the world is populated
very densely with those appreciative
people who, whether from a love of literature,
or with an instinct for collecting autographs
that may have a realizable value,
remove the signatures of distinguished men,
and with them anything original they may
have written."</p>

<p>Browning pokes fun at the poetry of his
inn album, but at the same time uses it as an
important part of the machinery in the action.
His English "Iago" writes in it the final
damnation of his own character&mdash;the threat
by means of which he hopes to ruin his victims,
but which, instead, causes the lady to
take poison and the young man to murder
"Iago."</p>

<p>The presence of the two men at this particular
inn is explained in the following bit of
conversation between them.</p>

<p>They become so deeply interested in this
talk that the train is missed, and, in the meantime,
the lady who now lives in the neighborhood
as the wife of the hard-working country
parson meets the young girl at the inn. They
are great friends and have come there, at the
girl's invitation, to talk over her prospective
husband. She desires her friend to come to
her home and meet her fianc&eacute;, but the lady,
who is in constant fear of meeting "Iago,"
never goes anywhere, and proposes a meeting
with him at the inn. While she waits, "Iago"
comes in upon her. There is a terrible scene
of recrimination between these two, the man
again daring to prefer his love. The lady
scorns him. Horror is added to horror when
the young man appears at the door, and recognizes
the woman he really loves. His faith
in her and his love are shaken for a moment,
but return immediately and he stands her
true friend and lover. The complete despicableness
of "Iago's" nature finally reveals
itself in the lines he writes in the album and
gives to the lady to read. The poem is too
long to quote in full. The closing scene,
however, will give the reader a good idea of<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
the poet's handling of this nineteenth-century
tragedy.</p>

<p>The true nobility of soul of the younger
man links him with Mertoun among Browning's
heroes and represents the Englishman
or the man of any country for that matter at
his highest. Whether redemption for the
older man would have been possible had the
lady believed him in the inn parlor is doubtful.
Such natures are like Ibsen's "Peer
Gynt." They need to be put into a button
mould and moulded over again.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="subtitle">RELIGIOUS THOUGHT IN THE NINETEENTH
CENTURY</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">In</span> "Bishop Blougram's Apology" and
"Christmas-Eve and Easter Day," Browning
has covered the main tendencies in religious
thought of the nineteenth century in
England; and possibly "Caliban" might be
included as representative of Calvinistic survivals
of the century.</p>

<p>The two most strongly marked of these
tendencies have been shown in the Tractarian
Movement which took Anglican in
the direction of High Churchism and Catholicism,
and in the Scientific Movement which
led in the direction of Agnosticism.</p>

<p>The battle between the Church of Rome
and the Church of England was waged the
latter part of the first half of the century, and
the greater battle between science and religion
came on in its full strength the middle
of the century when the influence of Spencer,
Darwin, Tyndall, Huxley and other men of
science began to make itself felt, as well as<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
that of such critics of historical Christianity
as Strauss in Germany and Renan in France.
The influence of the dissenting bodies,&mdash;the
Presbyterians and the Methodists&mdash;also became
a power during the century. Broadly
speaking, it may be said that the development
has been in the direction of the utmost freedom
of conscience in the matter of religion,
though the struggles of humanity to arrive
there even during this century are distressing
to look back upon; and occasionally one is held
up even in America to-day by the ghost of
religious persecution.</p>

<p>It is an open secret that in Bishop Blougram,
Browning meant to portray Cardinal
Wiseman, whose connection with the Tractarian
Movement is of great interest in the
history of this movement. Browning enjoyed
hugely the joke that Cardinal Wiseman himself
reviewed the poem. The Cardinal praised
it as a poem, though he did not consider the
attitude of a priest of Rome to be properly
interpreted. A comparison of the poem with
opinions expressed by the Cardinal as well as
a glimpse into his activities will show how
far Browning has done him justice.</p>

<p>It is well to remember at the outset that the
poet's own view is neither that of Blougram
nor of the literary man Gigadibs, with whom<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
Blougram talks over his wine. Gigadibs is
an agnostic and cannot understand how a
man of Blougram's fine intellectual and artistic
perceptions is able so implicitly to believe
in Catholic doctrine. Blougram's apology for
himself amounts to this,&mdash;that he does not
believe with absolute certainty any more than
does Gigadibs; but, on the other hand, Gigadibs
does not disbelieve with absolute certainty,
so Blougram's state is one of belief
shaken occasionally by doubt, while Gigadibs
is one of unbelief shaken by fits of belief.</p>

<h3>BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2 dotwide">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Now come, let's backward to the starting place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See my way: we're two college friends, suppose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prepare together for our voyage, then;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each note and check the other in his work,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's mine, a bishop's outfit; criticize!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What's wrong? why won't you be a bishop too?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">What first, you don't believe, you don't, and can't,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Not statedly, that is, and fixedly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And absolutely and exclusively)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In any revelation called divine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No dogmas nail your faith; and what remains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But say so, like the honest man you are?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First, therefore, overhaul theology!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, I too, not a fool, you please to think,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must find believing every whit as hard:<br /></span><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
<span class="i0">And if I do not frankly say as much,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ugly consequence is clear enough.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Now wait, my friend: well, I do not believe&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you'll accept no faith that is not fixed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Absolute and exclusive, as you say.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You're wrong&mdash;I mean to prove it in due time.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meanwhile, I know where difficulties lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could not, cannot solve, nor ever shall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So give up hope accordingly to solve&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(To you, and over the wine). Our dogmas then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With both of us, though in unlike degree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Missing full credence&mdash;overboard with them!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mean to meet you on your own premise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good, there go mine in company with yours!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And now what are we? unbelievers both,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calm and complete, determinately fixed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-day, to-morrow and forever, pray?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You'll guarantee me that? Not so, I think!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In no wise! all we've gained is, that belief.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As unbelief before, shakes us by fits,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confounds us like its predecessor. Where's<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gain? how can we guard our unbelief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make it bear fruit to us?&mdash;the problem here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just when we are safest, there's a sunset touch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fancy from a flower-bell, some one's death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A chorus-ending from Euripides,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that's enough for fifty hopes and fears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As old and new at once as nature's self,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rap and knock and enter in our soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take hands and dance there, a fantastic ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round the ancient idol, on his base again,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grand Perhaps! We look on helplessly.<br /></span><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
<span class="i0">There the old misgivings, crooked questions are&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This good God,&mdash;what he could do, if he would,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would, if he could&mdash;then must have done long since:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If so, when, where and how? some way must be,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once feel about, and soon or late you hit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some sense, in which it might be, after all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why not, "The Way, the Truth, the Life?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The advantage of making belief instead of
unbelief the starting point is, Blougram contends,
that he lives by what he finds the most
to his taste; giving him as it does, power,
distinction and beauty in life as well as hope
in the life to come.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Well, now, there's one great form of Christian faith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I happened to be born in&mdash;which to teach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was given me as I grew up, on all hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As best and readiest means of living by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same on examination being proved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The most pronounced moreover, fixed, precise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And absolute form of faith in the whole world&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accordingly, most potent of all forms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For working on the world. Observe, my friend!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as you know me, I am free to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In these hard latter days which hamper one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myself&mdash;by no immoderate exercise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of intellect and learning, but the tact<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To let external forces work for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Bid the street's stones be bread and they are bread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bid Peter's creed, or rather, Hildebrand's,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exalt me o'er my fellows in the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make my life an ease and joy and pride;<br /></span><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
<span class="i0">It does so,&mdash;which for me's a great point gained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who have a soul and body that exact<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A comfortable care in many ways.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's power in me and will to dominate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which I must exercise, they hurt me else:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In many ways I need mankind's respect,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obedience, and the love that's born of fear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While at the same time, there's a taste I have,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A toy of soul, a titillating thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refuses to digest these dainties crude.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The naked life is gross till clothed upon:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must take what men offer, with a grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though I would not, could I help it, take!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An uniform I wear though over-rich&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something imposed on me, no choice of mine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No fancy-dress worn for pure fancy's sake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And despicable therefore! now folk kneel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kiss my hand&mdash;of course the Church's hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus I am made, thus life is best for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus that it should be I have procured;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">You'll reply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So far my choice, no doubt, is a success;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But were I made of better elements,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">with nobler instincts, purer tastes, like you,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Grant I'm a beast, why, beasts must lead beasts' lives!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suppose I own at once to tail and claws;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tailless man exceeds me: but being tailed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll lash out lion fashion, and leave apes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dock their stump and dress their haunches up.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My business is not to remake myself,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Say you, my fault is I address myself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To grosser estimators than should judge?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that's no way of holding up the soul,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While the mad houseful's plaudits near outbang<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Nay, friend, I meet you with an answer here&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That even your prime men who appraise their kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are men still, catch a wheel within a wheel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See more in a truth than the truth's simple self,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sixty the minute; what's to note in that?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Him you must watch&mdash;he's sure to fall, yet stands!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our interest's on the dangerous edge of things.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The honest thief, the tender murderer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The superstitious atheist, demirep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That loves and saves her soul in new French books&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We watch while these in equilibrium keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The giddy line midway: one step aside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They're classed and done with. I, then, keep the line<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before your sages,&mdash;just the men to shrink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the gross weights, coarse scales and labels broad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You offer their refinement. Fool or knave?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why needs a bishop be a fool or knave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When there's a thousand diamond weights between?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, I enlist them. Your picked twelve, you'll find,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">At thus being held unable to explain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How a superior man who disbelieves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May not believe as well: that's Schelling's way!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It's through my coming in the tail of time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nicking the minute with a happy tact.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had I been born three hundred years ago<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They'd say, "what's strange? Blougram of course believes;"<br /></span>

<p>Turning to the life of Cardinal Wiseman,
it is of especial interest in connection with
Browning's portrayal of him to observe his
earlier years. He was born in Spain, having
a Spanish father of English descent and an
English mother, all Catholics, as Blougram
says, "There's one great form of Christian
faith I happened to be born in." His mother
took him as an infant, and laid him upon the
altar of the Cathedral of Seville, and consecrated
him to the service of the Church.</p>

<p class="caption">Cardinal Wiseman</p>
</div>

<p>His father having died when he was a tiny
boy, his mother took him and his brother to
England where he was trained at the Catholic
college of Ushaw. From there he went to
Rome to study at the English Catholic College
there. Later he became Rector of this College.
The sketch of Wiseman at this period
given by his biographer, Wilfred Ward, is
most attractive. "Scattered through his 'Recollections'
are interesting impressions left
by his student life. While mastering the
regular course of scholastic philosophy and
theology sufficiently to take his degree with
credit, his tastes were not primarily in this
direction. The study of Roman antiquities,
Christian and Pagan, was congenial to him,
as was also the study of Italian art&mdash;in which
he ultimately became proficient&mdash;and of
music: and he early devoted himself to the
Syriac and Arabic languages. In all these
pursuits the enthusiasm and eminence of men
living in Rome itself at this era of renaissance
was a potent stimulus to work. The hours
he set aside for reading were many more than
the rule demanded. But the daily walk and
the occasional expedition to places of historic
interest outside of Rome helped also to store
his mind and to fire his imagination." Wiseman
writes, himself, of this period, "The life
of the student in Rome should be one of
unblended enjoyment. His very relaxations
become at once subsidiary to his work and yet
most delightfully recreative. His daily walks
may be through the field of art ... his
wanderings along the stream of time ... a
thousand memories, a thousand associations
accompany him." From this letter and from
accounts of him he would seem to have been<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
possessed of a highly imaginative temperament,
possibly more artistic than religious.
Scholars, linguists, or historians, artists or
antiquarians interested him far more than
thinkers or theologians. In noting the effects
on Wiseman's character of the thoughts and
sights of Rome, "it must be observed," writes
Ward, "that even the action of directly religious
influences brought out his excessive
impressionableness. His own inner life was
as vivid a pageant to him as the history of the
Church. He was liable at this time to the
periods of spiritual exaltation&mdash;matched, as we
shall see later on, by fits of intense despondency&mdash;which
marked him through life."</p>

<p>This remarkable intellectual activity brought
with it doubts of religious truth. "The
imaginative delight in Rome as a living
witness to the faith entirely left him, and
at the same time he was attacked by mental
disturbances and doubts of the truth of
Christianity. There are contemporary indications,
and still plainer accounts in the
letters of his later life, of acute suffering from
these trials. The study of Biblical criticism,
even in the early stages it had then reached,
seems immediately to have occasioned them;
and the suffering they caused him was aggravated
into intense and almost alarming de<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>pression
by the feebleness of his bodily health."
He says, speaking of this phase in his life,
"Many and many an hour have I passed, alone,
in bitter tears, on the <i>loggia</i> of the English
College, when every one was reposing in the
afternoon, and I was fighting with subtle
thoughts and venomous suggestions of a
fiendlike infidelity which I durst not confide
to any one, for there was no one that could
have sympathized with me. This lasted for
years; but it made me study and think, to
conquer the plague&mdash;for I can hardly call
it danger&mdash;both for myself and for others.
But during the actual struggle the simple
submission of faith is the only remedy.
Thoughts against faith must be treated at
the time like temptations against any other
virtue&mdash;put away; though in cooler moments
they may be safely analyzed and unraveled."
Again he wrote of these years as,
"Years of solitude, of desolation, years of
shattered nerves, dread often of instant insanity,
consumptive weakness, of sleepless
nights and weary days, and hours of tears
which no one witnessed."</p>

<p>"Of the effect of these years of desolation
on his character he speaks as being simply
invaluable. It completed what Ushaw had
begun, the training in patience, self-reliance,<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
and concentration in spite of mental depression.
It was amid these trials, he adds, 'that
I wrote my "Hor&aelig; Syriac&aelig;" and collected
my notes for the lectures on the "Connection
between Science and Revealed Religion" and
the "Eucharist." Without this training I
should not have thrown myself into the
Puseyite controversy at a later period.' Any
usefulness which discovered itself in later
years he considers the 'result of self-discipline'
during his inner conflict. The struggle so
absorbed his energies that his early life was
passed almost wholly free from the special
trials to which that period is liable. He speaks
of his youth as in that respect 'almost temptationless.'"
This state of mind seemed to
last about five years and then he writes in
a letter:</p>

<p>"I have felt myself for some months gradually
passing into a new state of mind and
heart which I can hardly describe, but which
I trust is the last stage of mental progress, in
which I hope I may much improve, but out
of which I trust I may never pass. I could
hardly express the calm mild frame of mind
in which I have lived; company and society
I have almost entirely shunned, or have moved
through it as a stranger; hardly a disturbing
thought, hardly a grating sensation has crossed<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
my being, of which a great feeling of love
seems to have been the principle. Whither,
I am inclined to ask myself, does all this
tend? Whence does it proceed? I think I
could make an interesting history of my
mind's religious progress, if I may use a word
shockingly perverted by modern fanatics, from
the hard dry struggles I used to have when
first I commenced to study on my own account,
to the settling down into a state of stern
conviction, and so after some years to the
nobler and more soothing evidences furnished
by the grand harmonies and beautiful features
of religion, whether considered in contact
with lower objects or viewed in her own
crystal mirror. I find it curious, too, and interesting
to trace the workings of those varied
feelings upon my relations to the outward
world. I remember how for years I lost all
relish for the glorious ceremonies of the
Church. I heeded not its venerable monuments
and sacred records scattered over the
city; or I studied them all with the dry eye
of an antiquarian, looking in them for proofs,
not for sensations, being ever actively alive
to the collection of evidences and demonstrations
of religious truth. But now that the
time of my probation as I hope it was, is past,
I feel as though the freshness of childhood's<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
thoughts had once more returned to me, my
heart expands with renewed delight and delicious
feelings every time I see the holy objects
and practices around me, and I might
almost say that I am leading a life of spiritual
epicureanism, opening all my senses to a rich
draught of religious sensations."</p>

<p>From these glimpses it would appear that
Wiseman was a much more sincere man in
his religious feeling than he is given credit for
by Browning. His belief is with him not a matter
of cold, hard calculation as to the attitude
which will be, so to speak, the most politic
from both a worldly and a spiritual point of
view. The beautiful passage beginning "Just
when we are safest, there's a sunset touch"
etc., comes nearer to the genuine enthusiasm
of a Wiseman than any other in the poem.
There is an essential difference between the
minds of the poet and the man he portrays,
which perhaps made it impossible for Browning
fully to interpret Wiseman's attitude.
Both have religious fervor, but Browning's
is born of a consciousness of God revealed
directly to himself, while Wiseman's consciousness
of God comes to him primarily
through the authority of the Church, that is
through generations of authoritative believers
the first of whom experienced the actuality of<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
Revelation. Hundreds and thousands of
people have minds of this caliber. They
cannot see a truth direct for themselves, they
must be told by some person clothed in
authority that this or that is true or false.
To Wiseman the beauty of his own form of
religion with its special dogmas made so
strong an appeal, that, since he could only
believe through authority, under any circumstances,
it was natural to him to adopt the
particular form that gave him the most satisfaction.
Proofs detrimental to belief do not
worry long with doubts such a mind, because
the authority they depend on is not the authority
of knowledge, but the authority of belief.
This comes out clearly enough in one of
Wiseman's letters in which after enumerating
a number of proofs brought forward by various
scholars tending to cast discredit on the
dogmas of the Church, he triumphantly exclaims,
"And yet, who that has an understanding
to judge, is driven for a moment
from the holdings of faith by such comparisons
as these!"</p>

<p class="caption">Sacred Heart</p>
<p class="center smaller"><i>F. Utenbach</i></p>
</div>

<p>Upon looking through his writings there
will always be found in his expression of belief,
I think, that ring of true sincerity as well
as what I should call an intense artistic delight
in the essential beauty of his religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
As to Blougram's argument that he believed
in living in the world while he was in it,
Wiseman's life was certainly not that of a
worldling alone, though he is described by
one person as being "a genuine priest, very
good looking and able bodied, and with much
apparent practice in the world." He was far
too much of a student and worker to be altogether
so worldly-minded as Browning represents
him.</p>

<p>His chief interest for Englishmen is his
connection with the Tractarian Movement.
The wish of his soul was to aid the Catholic
Revival in England, and with that end in
view he visited England in 1835. Two
years before, the movement at Oxford, known
as the Tractarian Movement had begun.
The opinions of the men in this movement
were, as every one knows, printed in a series
of ninety tracts of which Newman wrote
twenty-four. It was an outgrowth of the
conditions of the time. To sum up in the
words of Withrow,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> "The Church of England
had distinctly lost ground as a directing and
controlling force in the nation. The most
thoughtful and earnest minds in the Church
felt the need of a great religious awakening
and an aggressive movement to regain its<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
lost influence." As Dean Church describes
them, the two characteristic forms of Christianity
in the Church of England were the
High Church, and the Evangelicals, or Low
<a name='TC_38'></a><ins title="Left in ending quote with unknown start">Church."</ins> Of the former he says: "Its better
members were highly cultivated, benevolent
men, intolerant of irregularities both of doctrine
and life, whose lives were governed by
an unostentatious but solid and unfaltering
piety, ready to burst forth on occasion into
fervid devotion. Its worse members were
jobbers and hunters after preferment, pluralists
who built fortunes and endowed families
out of the Church, or country gentlemen in
orders, who rode to hounds and shot and
danced and farmed, and often did worse
things."</p>

<p>But at Oxford was a group of men of intense
moral earnestness including Newman,
Pusey, Keble, Arnold, Maurice, Kingsley, and
others, who began an active propaganda of
the new or revised doctrines of the Oxford
Movement.</p>

<p>"The success of the Tracts," says Molesworth,
"was much greater, and the outcry
against them far louder and fiercer, than their
authors had expected. The Tracts were at
first small and simple, but became large and
learned theological treatises. Changes, too,<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
came over the views of some of the writers.
Doctrines which probably would have shocked
them at first were put forward with a recklessness
which success had increased. Alarm
was excited, remonstrances stronger and
stronger were addressed to them. They were
attacked as Romanizing in their tendency."</p>

<p>"The effect of such writing was two-fold<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>&mdash;the
public were dismayed and certain members
of the Tractarian party avowed their
intention of becoming Romanists. So decided
was the setting of the tide towards Rome
that Newman made a vigorous effort to turn
it by his famous Tract No. 90. In this he
endeavored to show that it was possible to
interpret the Thirty-nine Articles in the interest
of Roman Catholicism. This tract
aroused a storm of indignation. The violent
controversy which it occasioned led to
the discontinuance of the series."</p>

<p>Such in little was this remarkable movement.
When Tract No. 90 appeared Wiseman
had been in England for some time, and
had been a strong influence in taking many
thinking men in the direction of Rome. His
lectures and discourses upon his first visit to
England had attracted remarkable attention.
The account runs by one who attended his<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
lectures to Catholics and Protestants: "Society
in this country was impressed, and listened
almost against its will, and listened not
displeased. Here was a young Roman priest,
fresh from the center of Catholicism, who
showed himself master, not only of the intricacies
of polemical discussion but of the
amenities of civilized life. The spacious
church of Moorfields was thronged on every
evening of Dr. Wiseman's appearance. Many
persons of position and education were converted,
and all departed with abated prejudice,
and with very different notions about
Catholicism from those with which they had
been prepossessed by their education." Wiseman,
himself, wrote, "I had the consolation
of witnessing the patient and edifying attention
of a crowded audience, many of whom
stood for two hours without any symptom of
impatience."</p>

<p>The great triumph for Wiseman, however,
was when, shortly after Tract 90, Newman,
"a man," described "in many ways, the most
remarkable that England has seen during the
century, perhaps the most remarkable whom
the English Church has produced in any century,"
went over to the Church of Rome and
was confirmed by Wiseman. Others followed
his example and by 1853 as many as four<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
hundred clergymen and laity had become
Roman Catholics.</p>

<p>The controversies and discussions of that
time, it must be remembered, were more upon
the dogmas of the church than upon what we
should call to-day the essential truths of religion.
Yet, to a certain order of mind dogmas
seem important truths. There are those
whose religious attitude cannot be preserved
without belief in dogmas, and the advantage
of the Catholic Church is that it holds firmly
to its dogmas, come what may. It was expected,
however, that this Romeward Movement
would arouse intense antipathy. "The
arguments by which it was justified were considered,
in many cases, disingenuous, if not
Jesuitical."</p>

<p>In opposition of this sort we come nearer
to Browning's attitude of mind. Because
such arguments as Wiseman and the Tractarians
used could not convince him, he takes
the ordinary ground of the opposition, that in
using such arguments they must be insincere,
and they must be perfectly conscious of their
insincerity. Still, in spite of the fact that
Browning's mind could not get inside of
Blougram's, he shows that he has some sympathy
for the Bishop in the close of the poem
where he says, "He said true things but called<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
them by wrong names." Raise Blougram's
philosophy to the plane of the mysticism of
a Browning, and the arguments for belief
would be much the same but the <i>counters</i> in
the arguments would become symbols instead
of dogmas.</p>

<p>In "Christmas-Eve and Easter Day,"
Browning becomes the true critic of the
nineteenth-century religious movements. He
passes in review in a series of dramatic pictures
the three most diverse modes of religious
thought of the century. The dissenter's
view is symbolized by a scene in a very humble
chapel in England, the Catholic view by a
vision of high mass at St. Peter's and the
Agnostic view by a vision of a lecture by a
learned German professor,&mdash;while the view
of the modern mystic who remains religious
in the face of all destructive criticism is shown
in the speaker of the poem. The intuitional,
aspiring side of his nature is symbolized by
the vision of Christ that appears to him, while
the intensity of its power fluctuates as he
either holds fast or lets go the garment of
Christ. Opposed to his intuitional side is his
reasoning side.</p>

<p>Possibly the picture of the dissenting chapel
is exaggeratedly humble, though if we suppose
it to be a Methodist Chapel, it may be<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
true to life, as Methodism was the form of
religion which made its appeal to the lowest
classes. Indeed, at the time of its first successes,
it was the saving grace of England.
"But for the moral antiseptic," writes Withrow,
"furnished by Methodism, and the revival of
religion in all the churches which it produced,
the history of England would have
been far other than it was. It would probably
have been swept into the maelstrom of revolution
and shared the political and religious
convulsions of the neighboring nation," that
is the French Revolution.</p>

<p>"But Methodism had greatly changed the
condition of the people. It had rescued vast
multitudes from ignorance and barbarism,
and raised them from almost the degradation
of beasts to the condition of men and the
fellowship of saints. The habits of thrift and
industry which it fostered led to the accumulation,
if not of wealth, at least to that of a
substantial competence; and built up that
safeguard of the Commonwealth, a great, intelligent,
industrious, religious Middle-Class in
the community."</p>

<p>After the death of Wesley came various
divisions in the Methodist Church; it has so
flexible a system that it may be adapted to
very varied needs of humanity, and in that<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
has consisted its great power. The mission
of the church was originally to the poor and
lowly, but "It has won for itself in spite of
scorn and persecution," says Dr. Sch&ouml;ll, "a
place of power in the State and church of
Great Britain."</p>

<p>A scornful attitude is vividly brought
before us in the opening of this poem, to be
succeeded later by a more charitable point of
view.</p>

<span class="i0">Out of the little chapel I burst<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Into the fresh night-air again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Five minutes full, I waited first<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the doorway, to escape the rain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That drove in gusts down the common's centre<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At the edge of which the chapel stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before I plucked up heart to enter.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Heaven knows how many sorts of hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reached past me, groping for the latch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the inner door that hung on catch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More obstinate the more they fumbled,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till, giving way at last with a scold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the crazy hinge, in squeezed or tumbled<br /></span>
<span class="i2">One sheep more to the rest in fold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left me irresolute, standing sentry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the sheepfold's lath-and-plaster entry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Six feet long by three feet wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Partitioned off from the vast inside<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I blocked up half of it at least.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No remedy; the rain kept driving.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They eyed me much as some wild beast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That congregation, still arriving,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some of them by the main road, white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A long way past me into the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Skirting the common, then diverging;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a few suddenly emerging<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the common's self thro' the paling-gaps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;They house in the gravel-pits perhaps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the road stops short with its safeguard border<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lamps, as tired of such disorder;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the most turned in yet more abruptly<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From a certain squalid knot of alleys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the town's bad blood once slept corruptly,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which now the little chapel rallies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leads into day again,&mdash;its priestliness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lending itself to hide their beastliness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So cleverly (thanks in part to the mason),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And putting so cheery a whitewashed face on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those neophytes too much in lack of it,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That, where you cross the common as I did,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And meet the party thus presided,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Mount Zion" with Love-lane at the back of it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They front you as little disconcerted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As, bound for the hills, her fate averted,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Well, from the road, the lanes or the common<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Her umbrella with a mighty report,<br /></span><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
<span class="i0">Grounded it by me, wry and flapping,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A wreck of whalebones; then, with a snort,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a startled horse, at the interloper<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Who humbly knew himself improper,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But could not shrink up small enough)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Round to the door, and in,&mdash;the gruff<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Making my very blood run cold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prompt in the wake of her, up-pattered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On broken clogs, the many-tattered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little old-faced peaking sister-turned-mother<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the sickly babe she tried to smother<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Somehow up, with its spotted face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the cold, on her breast, the one warm place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She too must stop, wring the poor ends dry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a draggled shawl, and add thereby<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her tribute to the door-mat, sopping<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already from my own clothes' dropping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which yet she seemed to grudge I should stand on:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then, stooping down to take off her pattens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She bore them defiantly, in each hand one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Planted together before her breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And its babe, as good as a lance in rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Close on her heels, the dingy satins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a female something, past me flitted,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With lips as much too white, as a streak<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lay far too red on each hollow cheek;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it seemed the very door-hinge pitied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that was left of a woman once,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holding at least its tongue for the nonce.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then a tall yellow man, like the <i>Penitent Thief</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his jaw bound up in a handkerchief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eyelids screwed together tight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led himself in by some inner light.<br /></span><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
<span class="i0">And, except from him, from each that entered,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I got the same interrogation&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What, you the alien, you have ventured<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To take with us, the elect, your station?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A carer for none of it, a <i>Gallio</i>!"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus, plain as print, I read the glance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At a common prey, in each countenance<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As of huntsman giving his hounds the tallyho.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, when the door's cry drowned their wonder,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The draught, it always sent in shutting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made the flame of the single tallow candle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the cracked square lantern I stood under,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shoot its blue lip at me, rebutting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it were, the luckless cause of scandal:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I verily fancied the zealous light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(In the chapel's secret, too!) for spite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would shudder itself clean off the wick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the airs of a Saint John's Candlestick.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was no standing it much longer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Good folks," thought I, as resolve grew stronger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"This way you perform the Grand-Inquisitor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the weather sends you a chance visitor?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You are the men, and wisdom shall die with you,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But still, despite the pretty perfection<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To which you carry your trick of exclusiveness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, taking God's word under wise protection,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Correct its tendency to diffusiveness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bid one reach it over hot plough-shares,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Still, as I say, though you've found salvation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If should choose to cry, as now, 'Shares!'&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">See if the best of you bars me my ration!<br /></span>

<span class="i2">So, shut your mouth and open your Testament,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Accordingly, as a shoemaker's lad<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With wizened face in want of soap,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And wet apron wound round his waist like a rope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(After stopping outside, for his cough was bad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To get the fit over, poor gentle creature,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so avoid disturbing the preacher)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Passed in, I sent my elbow spikewise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the shutting door, and entered likewise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Received the hinge's accustomed greeting,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And crossed the threshold's magic pentacle,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And found myself in full conventicle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;To wit, in Zion Chapel Meeting,<br /></span>

<p>The reasoning which follows upon this is
characteristic of Browning. Perceiving everywhere
in the world transcendent power, and
knowing love in little, from that transcendent
love may be deduced. His reasoning finally
brings him to a state of vision. His subjective

<span class="i0">But wherefore be harsh on a single case?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">After how many modes, this Christmas-Eve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does the self-same weary thing take place?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The same endeavor to make you believe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with much the same effect, no more:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Each method abundantly convincing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I say, to those convinced before,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But scarce to be swallowed without wincing<br /></span><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
<span class="i0">By the not-as-yet-convinced. For me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have my own church equally:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in this church my faith sprang first!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(I said, as I reached the rising ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wind began again, with a burst<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of rain in my face, and a glad rebound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the heart beneath, as if, God speeding me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I entered his church-door, nature leading me)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;In youth I looked to these very skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And probing their immensities,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I found God there, his visible power;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet felt in my heart, amid all its sense<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of the power, an equal evidence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That his love, there too, was the nobler dower.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the loving worm within its clod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were diviner than a loveless god<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid his worlds, I will dare to say.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You know what I mean: God's all, man's nought:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But also, God, whose pleasure brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man into being, stands away<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As it were a handbreadth off, to give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Room for the newly-made to live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And look at him from a place apart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And use his gifts of brain and heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Given, indeed, but to keep for ever.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who speaks of man, then, must not sever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man's very elements from man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying, "But all is God's"&mdash;whose plan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was to create man and then leave him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Able, his own word saith, to grieve him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But able to glorify him too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a mere machine could never do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That prayed or praised, all unaware<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of its fitness for aught but praise and prayer,<br /></span><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
<span class="i0">Made perfect as a thing of course.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man, therefore, stands on his own stock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of love and power as a pin-point rock:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, looking to God who ordained divorce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the rock from his boundless continent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sees, in his power made evident,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only excess by a million-fold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the power God gave man in the mould.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, note: man's hand, first formed to carry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A few pounds' weight, when taught to marry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its strength with an engine's, lifts a mountain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&mdash;Advancing in power by one degree;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And why count steps through eternity?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But love is the ever-springing fountain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man may enlarge or narrow his bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the water's play, but the water-head&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How can he multiply or reduce it?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As easy create it, as cause it to cease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He may profit by it, or abuse it,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But 'tis not a thing to bear increase<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As power does: be love less or more<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the heart of man, he keeps it shut<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or opes it wide, as he pleases, but<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love's sum remains what it was before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, gazing up, in my youth, at love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As seen through power, ever above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All modes which make it manifest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My soul brought all to a single test&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he, the Eternal First and Last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, in his power, had so surpassed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All man conceives of what is might,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose wisdom, too, showed infinite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Would prove as infinitely good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would never, (my soul understood,)<br /></span><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>

<span class="i0">Bestow e'en less than man requires;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he who endlessly was teaching,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above my spirit's utmost reaching,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What love can do in the leaf or stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(So that to master this alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This done in the stone or leaf for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must go on learning endlessly)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would never need that I, in turn,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Should point him out defect unheeded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And show that God had yet to learn<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What the meanest human creature needed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Not life, to wit, for a few short years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tracking his way through doubts and fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the stupid earth on which I stay<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Suffers no change, but passive adds<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Its myriad years to myriads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though I, he gave it to, decay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing death come and choose about me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my dearest ones depart without me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No: love which, on earth, amid all the shows of it,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Has ever been seen the sole good of life in it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The love, ever growing there, spite of the strife in it,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shall arise, made perfect, from death's repose of it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I shall behold thee, face to face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O God, and in thy light retrace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How in all I loved here, still wast thou!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom pressing to, then, as I fain would now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall find as able to satiate<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The love, thy gift, as my spirit's wonder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art able to quicken and sublimate,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With this sky of thine, that I now walk under,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And glory in thee for, as I gaze<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Fresh from chisel, pictures wet<br /></span>

<p>In his next experience the speaker learns
what the effect of scientific criticism has been
upon historical Christianity.</p>

<p>The warfare between science and religion
forms one of the most fascinating and terrible
chapters in the annals of the development of
the human mind. About the middle of the
nineteenth century the war became general.
It was no longer a question of a skirmish over
this or that particular discovery in science
which would cause some long-cherished dogma
to totter; it was a full battle all along the line,
and now that the smoke has cleared away, it<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
is safe to say that science sees, on the one
hand, it cannot conquer religion, and religion
sees, on the other, it cannot conquer science.
What each has done is to strip the other of
its untruths, leaving its truths to grow by
the light each holds up for the other. Together
they advance toward the knowledge of the
Most High.</p>

<p>He finds himself back in the chapel,
all that has occurred having been a vision.
His conclusions have that broadness of view
which belongs only to those most advanced
in thought. He has learned that not only
must there be the essential truth behind every
sincere effort to reach it, but that even his
own vision of the truth is not necessarily the
final way of truth but is merely the way which
is true for him. The jump from the attitude<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
of mind that persecutes those who do not
believe according to one established rule to
such absolute toleration of all forms because
of their symbolizing an eternal truth gives
the measure of growth in religious thought
from the days of Wesley to Browning. The
Wesleys and their fellow-helpers were stoned
and mobbed, and some died of their wounds
in the latter part of the eighteenth century,
while in 1850, when "Christmas-Eve" was
written, an Englishman could express a height
of toleration and sympathy for religions not
his own, as well as taking a religious stand
for himself so exalted that it is difficult to
imagine a further step in these directions.
Perhaps we are suffering to-day from over-toleration,
that is, we tolerate not only those
whose aspiration takes a different form, but
those whose ideals lead to degeneracy. It
seems as though all virtues must finally develop
their shadows. What, however, is a
shadow but the darkness occasioned by the
approach of some greater light.</p>

<p>In "Easter-Day" the interest is purely personal.
It is a long and somewhat intricate
discussion between two friends upon the basis
of belief and gives no glimpses of the historical
progress of belief. In brief, the poem
discusses the relation of the finite life to the
infinite life. The first speaker is not satisfied
with the different points of view suggested by
the second speaker. First, that one would
be willing to suffer martyrdom in this life if
only one could truly believe it would bring
eternal joy. Or perhaps doubt is God's way
of telling who are his friends, who are his
foes. Or perhaps God is revealed in the law
of the universe, or in the shows of nature, or<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
in the emotions of the human heart. The
first speaker takes the ground that the only
possibility satisfying modern demands is an
assurance that this world's gain is in its imperfectness
surety for true gain in another
world. An imaginatively pictured experience
of his own soul is next presented, wherein
he represents himself at the Judgment Day
as choosing the finite life instead of the infinite
life. As a result, he learns there is
nothing in finite life except as related to infinite
life. The way opened out toward the infinite
through love is that which gives the light of
life to all the good things of earth which he
desired&mdash;all beauties, that of nature and
art, and the joy of intellectual activity.</p>

<span class="i0">No longer, certain rays world-wide<br /></span>

<p>This poem has often been cited as a proof
of Browning's own belief in historical Chris<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>tianity.
It can hardly be said to be more
than a doubtful proof, for it depends upon a
subjective vision of which the speaker, himself,
doubts the truth. The speaker in this
poem belongs in the same category with
Bishop Blougram. A belief in infinite Love
can come to him only through the dogma of
the incarnation, he therefore holds to that,
no matter how tossed about by doubts. The
failure of all human effort to attain the Absolute
and, as a consequence, the belief in an
Absolute beyond this life is a dominant note
in Browning's own philosophy. The nature
of that Absolute he further evolves from the
intellectual observation of power that transcends
human comprehension, and the even
more deep-rooted sense of love in the human
heart.</p>

<p>Much of his thought resembles that of the
English scientist, Herbert Spencer. The relativity
of knowledge and the relativity of good
and evil are cardinal doctrines with both of
them. Herbert Spencer's mystery behind all
phenomena and Browning's failure of human
knowledge are identical&mdash;the negative proof
of the absolute,&mdash;but where Spencer contents
himself with the statement that though
we cannot know the Absolute, yet it must
transcend all that the human mind has con<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>ceived
of perfection, Browning, as we have
already seen, declares that we <i>can</i> know something
of the nature of that Absolute through
the love which we know in the human heart
as well as the power we see displayed in
Nature.</p>

<p>In connection with this subject, which for
lack of space can merely be touched on in
the present volume, it will be instructive to
round out Browning's presentations of his own
contributions to nineteenth-century thought
with two quotations, one from "The Parleyings:"
"With Bernard de Mandeville,"
and one from a poem in his last volume
"Reverie." In the first, human love is symbolized
as the image made by a lens of the
sun, which latter symbolizes Divine Love.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="subtitle">ART CRITICISM INSPIRED BY THE ENGLISH
MUSICIAN, AVISON</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">In</span> the "Parleying" "With Charles Avison,"
Browning plunges into a discussion of the
problem of the ephemeralness of musical expression.
He hits upon Avison to have his colloquy
with because a march by this musician
came into his head, and the march came into his
head for no better reason than that it was the
month of March. Some interest would attach
to Avison if it were only for the reason that he
was organist of the Church of St. Nicholas in
Newcastle-upon-Tyne. In the earliest accounts
St. Nicholas was styled simply, "The
Church of Newcastle-upon-Tyne," but in 1785
it became a Cathedral. This was after Avison's
death in 1770. All we know about the
organ upon which Avison performed is found
in a curious old history of Newcastle by
Brand. "I have found," he writes, "no account
of any organ in this church during the
times of popery though it is very probable
there has been one. <a name='TC_40'></a><ins title="Removed starting quote">About</ins> the year 1676,<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
the corporation of Newcastle contributed &pound;300
towards the erection of the present organ.
They added a trumpet stop to it June 22d,
1699."</p>

<p>The year that Avison was born, 1710, it is
recorded further that "the back front of this
organ was finished which cost the said corporation
&pound;200 together with the expense of
cleaning and repairing the whole instrument."</p>

<p>June 26, 1749, the common council of Newcastle
ordered a sweet stop to be added to the
organ. This was after Avison became organist,
his appointment to that post having been in
1736. So we know that he at least had a
"trumpet stop" and a "sweet stop," with
which to embellish his organ playing.</p>

<p>The church is especially distinguished for
the number and beauty of its chantries, and
any who have a taste for examining armorial
bearings will find two good-sized volumes devoted
to a description of those in this church,
by Richardson. Equal distinction attaches to
the church owing to the beauty of its steeple,
which has been called the pride and glory of
the Northern Hemisphere. According to the
enthusiastic Richardson it is justly esteemed
on account of its peculiar excellency of design
and delicacy of execution one of the finest
specimens of architectural beauty in Europe.<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
This steeple is as conspicuous a feature of
Newcastle as the State House Dome is of
Boston, situated, as it is, almost in the center
of the town. Richardson gives the following
minute description of this marvel. "It consists
of a square tower forty feet in width,
having great and small turrets with pinnacles
at the angles and center of each front tower.
From the four turrets at the angles spring
two arches, which meet in an intersecting direction,
and bear on their center an efficient
perforated lanthorne, surmounted by a tall and
beautiful spire: the angles of the lanthorne
have pinnacles similar to those on the turrets,
and the whole of the pinnacles, being twelve
in number, and the spire, are ornamented with
crockets and vanes."</p>

<p>There is a stirring tradition in regard to
this structure related by Bourne to the effect
that in the time of the Civil Wars, when the
Scots had besieged the town for several weeks,
and were still as far as at first from taking it,
the general sent a messenger to the mayor of
the town, and demanded the keys, and the
delivering up of the town, or he would immediately
demolish the steeple of St. Nicholas.
The mayor and aldermen upon hearing this,
immediately ordered a certain number of the
chiefest of the Scottish prisoners to be carried<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
up to the top of the tower, the place below
the lanthorne and there confined. After this,
they returned the general an answer to this
purpose,&mdash;that they would upon no terms deliver
up the town, but would to the last moment
defend it: that the steeple of St. Nicholas
was indeed a beautiful and magnificent piece
of architecture, and one of the great ornaments
of the town; but yet should be blown into
atoms before ransomed at such a rate: that,
however, if it was to fall, it should not fall
alone, that the same moment he destroyed the
beautiful structure he should bathe his hands
in the blood of his countrymen who were
placed there on purpose either to preserve it
from ruin or to die along with it. This message
had the desired effect. The men were
there kept prisoners during the whole time
of the siege and not so much as one gun fired
against it.</p>

<p>Avison, however, had other claims to distinction,
besides being organist of this ancient
church. He was a composer, and was remembered
by one of his airs, at least, into the
nineteenth century, namely "Sound the Loud
Timbrel." He appears not to be remembered,
however, by his concertos, of which
he published no less than five sets for a full
band of stringed instruments, nor by his<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
quartets and trios, and two sets of sonatas for
the harpsichord and two violins. All we have
to depend on now as to the quality of his
music are the strictures of a certain Dr. Hayes,
an Oxford Professor, who points out many
errors against the rules of composition in the
works of Avison, whence he infers that his
skill in music is not very profound, and the
somewhat more appreciative remarks of Hawkins
who says "The music of Avison is light
and elegant, but it wants originality, a necessary
consequence of his too close attachment
to the style of Geminiani which in a few particulars
only he was able to imitate."</p>

<p>Geminiani was a celebrated violin player
and composer of the day, who had come to
England from Italy. He is said to have held
his pupil, Avison, in high esteem and to have
paid him a visit at Newcastle in 1760. Avison's
early education was gained in Italy; and
in addition to his musical attainments he was a
scholar and a man of some literary acquirements.
It is not surprising, considering all
these educational advantages that he really
made something of a stir upon the publication
of his "small book," as Browning calls it,
with, we may add, its "large title."</p>

<p>The author of the "Remarks on the Essay
on Musical Expression" was the aforementioned
Dr. W. Hayes, and although the
learned doctor's pamphlet seems to have
died a natural death, some idea of its strictures
may be gained from Avison's reply.
The criticisms are rather too technical to be<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
of interest to the general reader, but one is
given here to show how gentlemanly a temper
Mr. Avison possessed when he was under
fire. His reply runs "His first critique, and,
I think, his masterpiece, contains many circumstantial,
but false and virulent remarks
on the first allegro of these concertos, to
which he supposes I would give the name of
<i>fugue</i>. Be it just what he pleases to call it
I shall not defend what the public is already
in possession of, the public being the most
proper judge. I shall only here observe, that
our critic has wilfully, or ignorantly, confounded
the terms <i>fugue</i> and <i>imitation</i>, which
latter is by no means subject to the same laws
with the former.</p>

<p>"Had I observed the method of answering
the <i>accidental subjects</i> in this <i>allegro</i>, as laid
down by our critic in his remarks, they must
have produced most shocking effects; which,
though this mechanic in music, would, perhaps,
have approved, yet better judges might,
in reality, have imagined I had known no
other art than that of the spruzzarino." There
is a nice independence about this that would
indicate Mr. Avison to be at least an aspirant
in the right direction in musical composition.
His criticism of Handel, too, at a time when
the world was divided between enthusiasm for<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
Handel and enthusiasm for Buononcini, shows
a remarkably just and penetrating estimate
of this great genius.</p>

<p>"Mr. Handel is, in music, what his own
Dryden was in poetry; nervous, exalted, and
harmonious; but voluminous, and, consequently,
not always correct. Their abilities
equal to every thing; their execution frequently
inferior. Born with genius capable of <i>soaring
the boldest flights</i>; they have sometimes, to
suit the vitiated taste of the age they lived in,
<i>descended to the lowest</i>. Yet, as both their
excellencies are infinitely more numerous than
their deficiencies, so both their characters will
devolve to latest posterity, not as models of
perfection, yet glorious examples of those
amazing powers that actuate the human
soul."</p>

<p>On the whole, Mr. Avison's "little book"
on Musical Expression is eminently sensible
as to the matter and very agreeable in style.
He hits off well, for example, the difference
between "musical expression" and imitation.</p>

<p>"As dissonances and shocking sounds cannot
be called Musical Expression, so neither
do I think, can mere imitation of several other
things be entitled to this name, which, however,
among the generality of mankind hath
often obtained it. Thus, the gradual rising<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
or falling of the notes in a long succession is
often used to denote ascent or descent; broken
intervals, to denote an interrupted motion;
a number of quick divisions, to describe
swiftness or flying; sounds resembling laughter,
to describe laughter; with a number of other
contrivances of a parallel kind, which it is
needless here to mention. Now all these I
should chuse to style imitation, rather than
expression; because it seems to me, that their
tendency is rather to fix the hearer's attention
on the similitude between the sounds and
the things which they describe, and thereby
to excite a reflex act of the understanding, than
to affect the heart and raise the passions of
the soul.</p>

<p>"This distinction seems more worthy our
notice at present, because some very eminent
composers have attached themselves chiefly to
the method here mentioned; and seem to
think they have exhausted all the depths of
expression, by a dextrous imitation of the
meaning of a few particular words, that occur
in the hymns or songs which they set to music.
Thus, were one of these gentlemen to express
the following words of <i>Milton</i>,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">&mdash;Their songs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to heav'n:<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>it is highly probable, that upon the word <i>divide</i>,
he would run a <i>division</i> of half a dozen bars;
and on the subsequent part of the sentence,
he would not think he had done the poet justice,
or <i>risen</i> to that <i>height</i> of sublimity which
he ought to express, till he had climbed up to
the very top of his instrument, or at least as
far as the human voice could follow him. And
this would pass with a great part of mankind
for musical expression; instead of that noble
mixture of solemn airs and various harmony,
which indeed elevates our thoughts, and gives
that exquisite pleasure, which none but true
lovers of harmony can feel." What Avison
calls "musical expression," we call to-day
"content." And thus Avison "tenders evidence
that music in his day as much absorbed
heart and soul then as Wagner's music now."
It is not unlikely that this very passage may
have started Browning off on his argumentative
way concerning the question: how lasting
and how fundamental are the powers of
musical expression.</p>

<p>The poet's memory goes back a hundred
years only to reach "The bands-man Avison
whose little book and large tune had led him
the long way from <a name='TC_41'></a><ins title="Added period">to-day.</ins>"</p>

<p>Then follows his explanation of the "hitch,"
which necessitates a comparison with the
other arts. His contention is that art adds
nothing to the <i>knowledge</i> of the mind. It
simply moulds into a fixed form elements already
known which before lay loose and dissociated,
it therefore does not really create.
But there is one realm, that of feeling, to
which the arts never succeed in giving per<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>manent
form though all try to do it. What is
it they succeed in getting? The poet does
not make the point very clear, but he seems
to be groping after the idea that the arts present
only the <i>phenomena</i> of feeling or the
image of feeling instead of the <i>reality</i>. Like
all people who are appreciative of music, he
realizes that music comes nearer to expressing
the spiritual reality of feeling than the other
arts, and yet music of all the arts is the least
permanent in its appeal.</p>

<p>The poet makes no attempt to give any
reason why music should be so ephemeral in
its appeal. He merely refers to the development
of harmony and modulation, nor does
it seem to enter his head that there can be
any question about the appeal being eph<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>emeral.
He imagines the possibility of resuscitating
dead and gone music with modern
harmonies and novel modulations, but gives
that up as an <a name='TC_42'></a><ins title="Was 'irreverant'">irreverent</ins> innovation. His
next mood is a historical one; dead and gone
music may have something for us in a historical
sense, that is, if we bring our life to
kindle theirs, we may sympathetically enter
into the life of the time.</p>

<p>The really serious conclusion of the poem
amounts to a doctrine of relativity in art and
not only in art but in ethics and religion. It is
a statement in poetry of the prevalent thought
of the nineteenth century, of which the most
widely known exponent was Herbert Spencer.
The form in which every truth manifests
itself is partial and therefore will pass, but the
underlying truth, the absolute which unfolds
itself in form after form is eternal. Every
manifestation in form, according to Browning,
however, has also its infinite value in relation
to the truth which is preserved through it.</p>

<p>As to the questions why music does not give
feeling immortality through sound, and why
it should be so ephemeral in its appeal, there
are various things to be said. It is just possible
that it may soon come to be recognized
that the psychic growth of humanity is more
perfectly reflected in music than any where
else. Ephemeralness may be predicated of
culture-music more certainly than of folk-music,
why? Because culture-music often has
occupied itself more with the technique than
with the content, while folk-music, being the
spontaneous expression of feeling must have
content. Folk-music, it is true, is simple, but
if it be genuine in its feeling I doubt whether
it ever loses its power to move. Therefore,
in folk-music is possibly made permanent
simple states of feeling. Now in culture-music,
the development has constantly been<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
in the direction of the expression of the ultimate
spiritual reality of emotions. Music is
now actually trying to accomplish what Browning
demands of it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">"Dredging deeper yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drag into day,&mdash;by sound, thy master-net,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The abysmal bottom-growth, ambiguous thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unbroken of a branch, palpitating<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With limbs' play and life's semblance! There it lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marvel and mystery, of mysteries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And marvels, most to love and laud thee for!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save it from chance and change we most abhor."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is true no matter what the emotion
may be. Hate may have its "eidolon" as
well as love. Above all arts, music has the
power of raising evil into a region of the artistically
beautiful. Doubt, despair, passion, become
blossoms plucked by the hand of God
when transmuted in the alembic of the brain
of genius&mdash;which is not saying that he need
experience any of these passions himself. In
fact, it is his power of perceiving the eidolon
of beauty in modes of passion or emotion not
his own that makes him the great genius.</p>

<p>It is doubtless true that whenever in culture-music
there has really been content aroused
by feeling, no matter what the stage of technique
reached, <i>that</i> music retains its power to
move. It is also highly probably that in the<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
earlier objective phases of music, even the
contemporary audiences were not moved in
the sense that we should be moved to-day.
The audiences were objective also and their
enthusiasm may have been aroused by merely
the imitative aspects of music as Avison called
them. It is certainly a fact that content and
form are more closely linked in music than in
any other art. Suppose, however, we imagine
the development of melody, counterpoint, harmony,
modulation, etc., to be symbolized by
a series of concrete materials like clay bricks,
silver bricks, gold bricks, diamond bricks;
a beautiful thought might take as exquisite
a form in bricks of clay as it would in diamond
bricks, or diamond bricks might be flung together
without any informing thought so that
they would attract only the thoughtless by
their glitter. But it also follows that, with
the increase in the kinds of bricks, there is an
increase in the possibilities for subtleties in
psychic expression, therefore music to-day is
coming nearer and nearer to the spiritual
reality of feeling. It requires the awakened
soul that Maeterlinck talks about, that is, the
soul alive to the spiritual essences of things to
recognize this new realm which composers
are bringing to us in music.</p>

<p>There are always, at least three kinds of<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
appreciators of music, those who can see
beauty only in the masters of the past, those
who can see beauty only in the last new composer,
and those who ecstatically welcome
beauty past, present and to come. These
last are not only psychically developed themselves,
but they are able to retain delight in
simpler modes of feeling. They may be
raised to a seventh heaven of delight by a Bach
fugue played on a clavichord by Mr. Dolmetsch,
feeling as if angels were ministering
unto them, or to a still higher heaven of delight
by a Tschaikowsky symphony or a string
quartet of Grieg, feeling that here the seraphim
continually do cry, or they may enter
into the very presence of the most High through
some subtly exquisite and psychic song of an
American composer, for some of the younger
American composers are indeed approaching
"Truth's very heart of truth," in their music.</p>

<p>On the whole, one gets rather the impression
that the poet has here tackled a problem
upon which he did not have great insight. He
passes from one mood to another, none of
which seem especially satisfactory to himself,
and concludes with one of the half-truths of
nineteenth-century thought. It is true as far
as it goes that forms evolve, and it is a good
truth to oppose to the martinets of settled<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
standards in poetry, music and painting; it is
also true that the form is a partial expression
of a whole truth, but there is the further truth
that, let a work of art be really a work of
genius, and the form as well as the content
touches the infinite; that is, we have as Browning
says in a poem already <a name='TC_44'></a><ins title="Added comma">quoted,</ins> "Bernard
de Mandeville," the very sun in little, or as he
makes Abt Vogler say of his music, the broken
arc which goes to the formation of the perfect
round, or to quote still another poem of Browning's,
"Cleon," the perfect rhomb or trapezoid
that has its own place in a mosaic pavement.</p>

<p>The poem closes in a rolicking frame of
mind, which is not remarkably consistent
with the preceding thought, except that the
poet seems determined to get all he can out of
the music of the past by enlivening it with his
own jolly mood. To this end he sets a patriotic
poem to the tune of Avison's march, in
honor of our old friend, Pym. It is a clever
<i>tour de force</i> for the words are made to match
exactly in rhythm and quantity the notes of
the march. Truth to say, the essential goodness
of the tune comes out by means of these
enlivening words.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
